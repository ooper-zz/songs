Verse 1:
G
I never knew your face, just a faded portrait,
Em
An image of a memory, that’s all that’s left.
G
In my heart, there’s an empty space,
Em
I dreamed you’d stay.

Chorus:
G
Only a picture to remember,
D
Lost moments, a silent ember.
Em
A broken bond,
C
In my dreams, you’ve never gone.

Verse 2:
G
I often wonder who you’d be,
Em
A guiding light, a friend to me.
G
Your absence is a plea,
Em
For the life we lost, what could have been.

Chorus:
G
Only a picture to remember,
D
Lost moments, a silent ember.
Em
A broken bond,
C
In my dreams, you’ve never gone.

Verse 3:
G
When my time comes,
Em
I hope to see your smiling face.
G
Don’t be too busy in heaven’s light,
Em
Wait for me at the gates, embrace me in flight.

Bridge:
G
This could have been me, we were apart for a time,
Em
The fragile thread of life can break the heart.
G
For now, I want to make it count, I got to make it count,
Em
For now, for the life we lost, now worlds apart.

Chorus:
G
Only a picture to remember,
D
Lost moments, a silent ember.
Em
A broken bond,
C
In my dreams, you’ve never gone.

Outro:
G
In heaven’s embrace, we’ll reunite,
Em
Two souls in flight.
G
Until then, I keep your memory close,
Em
Waiting for the day, without fear.
