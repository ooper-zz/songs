Verse 1:
G
I never knew your face,
Em
just a faded portrait,
G
An image of a memory,
Em
that’s all that’s left.
G
In my heart,
Em
there’s an empty space,
G
I dreamed
Em
you’d stay.

Chorus:
G
Only a picture
D
to remember,
Em
Lost moments,
C
a silent ember.
G
A broken bond,
D
In my dreams,
Em
you’ve never
C
gone.

Verse 2:
G
I often wonder
Em
who you’d be,
G
A guiding light,
Em
a friend to me.
G
Your absence
Em
is a plea,
G
For the life
Em
we lost, what could have been.

Chorus:
G
Only a picture
D
to remember,
Em
Lost moments,
C
a silent ember.
G
A broken bond,
D
In my dreams,
Em
you’ve never
C
gone.

Verse 3:
G
When my time
Em
comes,
G
I hope to see
Em
your smiling face.
G
Don’t be too busy
Em
in heaven’s light,
G
Wait for me
Em
at the gates, embrace me in flight.

Bridge:
G
This could have been me,
Em
we were apart for a time,
G
The fragile thread
Em
of life can break the heart.
G
For now,
Em
I want to make it count,
G
I got to make it count,
Em
For now,
G
for the life we lost,
Em
now worlds apart.

Chorus:
G
Only a picture
D
to remember,
Em
Lost moments,
C
a silent ember.
G
A broken bond,
D
In my dreams,
Em
you’ve never
C
gone.

Outro:
G
In heaven’s embrace,
Em
we’ll reunite,
G
Two souls
Em
in flight.
G
Until then,
Em
I keep your memory close,
G
Waiting for the day,
Em
without fear.
