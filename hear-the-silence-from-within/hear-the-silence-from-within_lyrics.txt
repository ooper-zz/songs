#Verse
Sunrise in your eyes
New day to embrace
Feel the beat
Let it guide
Claim your voice (Claim your voice)

#Chorus
Can’t let rhymes get in the way.
Let rivers flow, let tides collide.
Hear the silence from within!

#Hook
Hear the silence from within!
Words from your soul, Let rhythm steer
Each voice unique, Each note sincere.

#Bridge
No rules, Just harmony.
Let it be, feel freedom
Pure and free!

#Verse
Moments of silence,
World feels still,
Listen to the silence,

#Hook
What do whispers say?

#Chorus
Can’t let rhymes get in the way.
Let rivers flow, let tides collide.
Hear the silence from within!

#Hook
Hear the silence from within!

#Outro
Here’s to song within a song.
Let it rise, Let it stand tall!

#Hook
Here’s to song within a song.
Let it rise, Let it stand tall!

#Outro
What do whispers say?
Song within
Here’s to song within a song.
Let it rise, Let it stand tall!
