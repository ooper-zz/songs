#Verse
When I hit the road,
I cast my dreams a place to roam.

Yeah, I do not know where I'm going,
But I'm ready, my feet are glowing.

#Chorus
The voyage is the destination,
Where you find inspiration,
Taking the highs with the lows.
Hit "record" and out you go.

#Hook
La, la, la, la.
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.

#Verse
Be a local, speak their language, (At least try)
Do right at every turn,
Share stories, laugh, and cry.
(Be alive), do what's right,
Keep breathing, keep moving (oh-oh)

#Verse
Be a local,
Speak the language.
Do right at every turn,
Share stories, laugh, and cry.
Be alive,
Do what's right, keep breathing,
Keep moving.

Oh.

#Chorus
The voyage is the destination,
Where you find inspiration,
Taking the highs with the lows.
Hit "record" and out you go.

#Verse
Oh, that is worth getting,
Won't come easy, no forgetting.
Some will come and some will go,
But follow the way,

#Bridge
Give it your best, do what's right.
Pray or talk, what is the difference?
Pack up light, follow through,
Seek your purpose, seek your peace.

#Outro
Through every storm,
Learn your lessons.
Enjoy the ride or start anew.
But on this voyage,
You've got to keep breathing!
