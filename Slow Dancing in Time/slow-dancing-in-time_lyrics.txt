[Verse 1]
Hand in hand we step,
Moonlight on our side,
Just you and I,
and no clock for all time!

[Verse 2]
Your head softly 
on my shoulder,
soft Whisper, in my ear,
Together, feels so right!

[Chorus]
Slow dancing through time
Leave timekeeping behind
Our moments aligned
Our dreams come alive!

[Verse 3]
Stars up in the skies
Reflected in your eyes
One heartbeat, one pulse
In this dance, rest assured!

[interlude]

[Bridge]
Hold me closely
Lose all fear
In this timeless space
It's our own place!

[End]
Let's surrender,
It's how we'll "do" time...
together, forever!
