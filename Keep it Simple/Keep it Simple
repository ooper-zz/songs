Verse 1:
We search for answers far and wide,
Like lost keys slipping through our minds.
Retrace the steps, go back in time,
The truth was there, right in our eyes...

Chorus:
We miss the signs, they're hard to see,
But here’s how to fix it...
K-I-S-S...keep it simple, silly!
One tiny step, the path revealed,
Untangling knots we thought were sealed.

K-I-S-S...
keep it simple, silly!

[breath]

Verse 2:
We twist our thoughts, the knots grow tight,
But ask what’s wrong to clear our sight.
A simple truth, no need to shout,
The fog lifts when we let it out.

Chorus:
We miss the signs, they're hard to see,
But here’s how to fix it...
K-I-S-S...keep it simple, silly!
One tiny step, the path revealed,
Untangling knots we thought were sealed.

K-I-S-S...
keep it simple, silly!

[interlude]
Bridge:
It’s in the quiet, in the pause,
Where we debug and find the cause.
Small truths unlock the bigger knots,
The answer’s simpler than we thought.

Chorus:
We miss the signs, they're hard to see,
But here’s how to fix it...
K-I-S-S...keep it simple, silly!
One tiny step, the path revealed,
Untangling knots we thought were sealed.

K-I-S-S...
keep it simple, silly!
[fade out]
