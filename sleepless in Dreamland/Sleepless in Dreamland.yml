[Intro]
Restless nights, a mind adrift,
In the dark, an endless abyss,
In the light, a dreamer persists.
Sleepless in Dreamland!

[Verse 1]
Clock ticks, silence screams,
Alone, chasing dreams,
Moonlight shadows on the wall,
Dreams of an ant, outgrowing its shadow.

[Chorus]
Sleepless nights in Dreamland's grasp,
Time slips, shadows play,
Eyes wide, chasing dreams yet seen,
I'm Sleepless in Dreamland! 

[Verse 2]
Thoughts run wild, seeking peace,
In this, I lose the battle,
Eyes stay open, night to night,
Dreamland fades, out of sight!

[Chorus]
Sleepless nights in Dreamland's grasp,
Time slips as shadows play,
Eyes wide, chasing dreams yet seen,
I'm Sleepless in Dreamland! 

[interlude]

[Bridge]
In quiet, I find light,
Whispers soft, through the night,
Maybe sleep, will come in time,
Till then, these stars are mine!
These stars are mine! oh-oh!

[Fade Out]
[End]
