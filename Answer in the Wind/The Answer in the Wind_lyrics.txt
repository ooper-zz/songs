The Answer in the Wind

[Verse 1 – The Prophet Who Turned Away]
They called him a prophet, but he turned away,
Blowin’ through time, never meant to stay.
With riddles and rhymes, his words still ring,
A restless soul, seeking an unsung song to sing.

[Verse 2 – The Questions Still Remain]
The years keep on turning, the voices still cry,
The questions he asked never learned how to die.
They echo through highways, through alleys and fields,
Through hands that still tremble, through wounds never healed.

[Bridge – And So We Answer]
Maybe the answer was never just one,
Maybe it’s carved in the work left undone.
If love is the reason, if mercy still calls,
Then maybe the answer was never a wall.

[Verse 3 – When is a man truly a man? (The Journey’s the Destination)]
Bob sang of the roads, the miles left behind,
But a man ain't a man by the steps he can climb.
Not dust on his boots, not the battles he wins,
But the love that he sows, the hearts he lets in.

[Verse 4 – How long until freedom? (How to Save Love)]
He sang about chains, voices lost in the tide,
Of time moving slow while the dreamers still cry.
But freedom’s not written in laws or in stone,
It’s hands reaching out, so no one walks alone.

[Verse 5 – When will war end? (Carpe Diem – Seize the Day)]
The cannons still thunder, the flags still wave high,
But no anthem will quiet a mother’s goodbye.
Peace ain’t a treaty, a line in the sand,
It’s a seed in the soil, the touch of a hand.

[Verse 6 – How long before we listen? (Hear the Silence from Within)]
Bob asked how many ears must a man have to hear,
But the deafest are those still clinging to fear.
The cries on the wind, they still echo today,
But love breaks the silence and clears out the gray.

[Chorus – The Reflection]
We walk through the fire, we stand in the rain,
Chasing the answers, but the questions remain.
Maybe it’s not written, not carved into stone,
But the love that we sow—that’s the answer we’ve known.

[Outro – The Final Thought]
Bob sang in riddles, left truth undefined,
Maybe the wind knew the answer in time.
Maybe the question was always the key,
Maybe the answer was never for free.

[Verse 1]
You sang of nightmares, they crowned you a prophet
But the mirror kept flashing fanfare and profit
You walked out the door, left the folk folks behind
With grainy songs on the wind.

[Chorus]
They called you a prophet, but you turned away
Blowin’ through time, never meant to stay
With riddles and rhymes, your words still ring
A restless soul, seeking an unsung song to sing

[Bridge]
Was it written in fire, was it carved in stone?
Was it sung from the mountain, in a voice not his own?
Did it rise from the desert, did it fall with the tide?
Or did he chase it forever, with no place to hide?

[Outro]
Perhaps it was written, but never was read,
Perhaps it was whispered to ghosts instead.
Perhaps it’s not music, nor words that belong,
But the love that we sow—that’s the unsung song.
