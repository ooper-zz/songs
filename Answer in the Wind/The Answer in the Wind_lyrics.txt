[Verse 1]
You sang of nightmares, they crowned you a prophet
But the mirror kept flashing fanfare and profit
You walked out the door, left the folk folks behind
With grainy songs on the wind.

[Chorus]
They called you a prophet, but you turned away
Blowin’ through time, never meant to stay
With riddles and rhymes, your words still ring
A restless soul, seeking an unsung song to sing

[Bridge]
Was it written in fire, was it carved in stone?
Was it sung from the mountain, in a voice not his own?
Did it rise from the desert, did it fall with the tide?
Or did he chase it forever, with no place to hide?

[Outro]
Perhaps it was written, but never was read,
Perhaps it was whispered to ghosts instead.
Perhaps it’s not music, nor words that belong,
But the love that we sow—that’s the unsung song.
