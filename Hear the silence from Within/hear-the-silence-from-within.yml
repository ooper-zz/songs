Verse 1]
Sunrise in your eyes
New day to embrace
Feel the beat
Let it guide
Claim your voice

[Chorus]
Can’t let rhyme
Get in the way
Let rivers flow
Let tides collide
Hear the silence from within

[Verse 2]
Words from your soul
Let rhythm steer
Each voice unique
Each note sincere

[Bridge]
No rules
Just music
Let it be
Feel freedom
Pure and free

[Verse 3]
Moments of silence,
World feels still,
Listen to silence,
What do whispers say?

[Chorus]
Can’t let rhyme
Get in the way
Let rivers flow
Let tides collide
Hear the silence from within

[Outro]
Here’s to song
Within us all
Let it rise
Let it stand tall
