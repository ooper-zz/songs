[intro]
[Grand Piano]

[Verse 1]
Sunrise in your eyes,New day to embrace.
Feel the beat, Let it guide
Claim your voice...

[Powerpop Chorus]
Can’t let rhyme Get in the way.
Let rivers flow, Let tides collide.
Hear the silence from within!

[Verse 2]
Words from your soul, Let rhythm steer
Each voice unique, Each note sincere.

[Bridge]
No rules, Just harmony.
Let it be, Feel freedom
Pure and free!

[Verse 3]
Moments of silence,
World feels still,
Listen to the silence,

What do whispers say?

[Powerpop Chorus]
Can’t let rhyme Get in the way.
Let rivers flow, Let tides collide.
Hear the silence from within!

[Big Finish]
Here’s to song within a song.
Let it rise, Let it stand tall!

[End]
