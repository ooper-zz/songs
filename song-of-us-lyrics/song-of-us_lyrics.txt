[intro]
[soft acoustic grand piano]

[interlude] 

[verse 1]
why is it winning,
means somebody has to lose?
when life is full of colors, 
not just one or two?

oh, oh

[verse 2]
Don't you know, we're all notes,
 in a song we choose,
 and as keys and chords in a piano, 
we all shine through?

we all shine through! oo-oo-oo

[pre-chorus]
A wise man said, "Love your neighbor",
yet, we're too busy keeping favor...oh, oh!

[chorus]
Harmony, it's more than just a tune!!
We're all just keys lying on a piano,
so let's play in tune, let it flow! 

oh, let it flow!

'cause Harmony's the song of us...

[verse 2]
Why is it that battles rage, when peace could be the prize?
When every key on a piano, can make a melody rise?
Don't you see, rage's just a displeasing chord we despise,
while a song on a piano, can wipe tears from our eyes?

[pre-chorus]
A wise man said, "Turn the other cheek,"
yet we're too quick to judge, too slow to speak...

[chorus]
Harmony, it's more than just a tune!!
We're all just keys lying on a piano,
so let's play in tune, let it flow!
'cause Harmony's the song of us...

oh, let it flow!

[pre-chorus]
He gave so much, asking for so little,
why can't we give back,
and solve the riddle?

[chorus]
Harmony, it's more than just a tune!!
We're all just keys lying on a piano,
so let's play in tune, let it flow!

'cause Harmony's the song of us...

[outro]
What part will you play?
