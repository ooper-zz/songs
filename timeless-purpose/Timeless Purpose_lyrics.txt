[Intro Grand Piano solo]

[fade in]
[Verse]
Do we just exist and seek to fill,
Or connect the dots that fulfill?
What gives a life its meaning?
Is it found, or what we make?

[Chorus]
A legacy etched in the life we sketch,
Have a purpose, find what’s next.
It may shift, yet it lifts the soul,
It lights our way, it keeps us whole!

[Bridge ]
Some days the road feels cold and long,
But a spark remains to keep us strong,
And makes tomorrow brighter than today.

[Chorus]
A legacy etched in the life we sketch,
Have a purpose, to find what’s next.
It may shift, yet it lifts the soul,
It lights our way, it keeps us whole!

A timeless purpose keeps us whole...
