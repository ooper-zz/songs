[Verse 1]:

Chasing sunsets, new milestones
Meeting strangers, stories told
Laughter echoes, bonfire nights
Connections made along the way

[Pre-Chorus]:

Highs and lows, we roam
New place, new home
Every face and every smile
Makes the journey all worthwhile

[Chorus]:
Sharing rides, sharing dreams
From close ties to drifting apart
In every laugh, in every tear
Our heart is home, always connected!

Sharing rides, sharing dreams
From close ties to drifting apart
In every laugh, in every tear
Our heart is home, always connected

[Verse 2]:

Ancient paths, stories told
Footsteps echo, brave and bold
Tracing history, new trails unfold
In this journey, a new quest

[Bridge]:

Every sunset paints a scene
Moments fleeting, yet serene
Laughter rings, nights unseen
In these bonds, we find our dream

[Chorus]:

Sharing rides, sharing dreams
From connected to disconnected
In every laugh, every tear
Our heart is home, always connected

[Outro]:

Journeys end, but bonds remain
Memories linger, like the rain
As we part, one thing's clear
In our hearts, you're always near
