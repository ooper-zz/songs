[Verse 1]
Caught in the silence, words on the edge,
Time slows down, hanging by a thread.
Before the storm can make the rain,
Pause your world—rewrite the moment.

[Chorus]
Erase the hurt before it came,
Replace the echoes of the pain.
A better story waits untold,
Rewrite the moment before it’s cold.

[Verse 2]
In every moment, a choice to mend,
Erase the echoes, let the healing begin.
Before regret can stake its claim,
Pause your world—rewrite the moment.

[Chorus]
Erase the hurt before it came,
Replace the echoes of the pain.
A better story waits untold,
Rewrite the moment before it’s cold.

[Bridge]
The script’s not written, I hold the pen,
I can rewrite where it began.
No fate, no past to get in the way,
I choose the moment, turn it to memento.

[Outro]
Pause the moment, let it stay,
Rewrite the moment, turn it to memento.
