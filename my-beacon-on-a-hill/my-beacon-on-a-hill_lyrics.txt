Verse 1
We walked by the old station, still stands today
My teenage heart racing, just glad to feel that way
You rested your arm 'round my shoulders that day
It didn’t last long... one moment of warmth
Did we start with the outro of this song?

Chorus
I’m here, still writing this song
'Cause saying it plain just skips like a stone
You stepped into a broken heart—
and I filled the space with love
'Cause I’m stuck in the bridge—
And I still don’t know...
But you were my beacon on a hill!

Verse 2
The song took its own melody
But you’re still a part of me
Beyond the shield, beyond the role—
And that…
is invaluable.
And I just want to say
I love you
once more

Chorus (Reprise)
I’m here, still writing this song
'Cause saying it plain just skips like a stone
You stepped into a broken heart—
and I filled the space with love
'Cause I’m stuck in the bridge—
And I still don’t know...
But you were my beacon on a hill!

Bridge
Maybe love’s not a chorus,
Sometimes just a line that lands out of tune
Meant to be written by two—
But maybe we’re not quite through

Outro
No need for answers
Just this one line:
to say I love you
once more.

(That’s all.)
