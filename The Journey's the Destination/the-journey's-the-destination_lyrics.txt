#Version
When I hit the road,
I cast my dreams a place to roam.

Yeah, I do not know where I'm going,
But I'm ready, my feet are glowing.

#Chorus
The voyage is the destination,
Where you find inspiration,
Taking the highs with the lows.
Hit record and out you go.

#Hook
La, la, la, la.
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.

#Hook
Be a local, speak their language,
At least try.

#Verse
Do right at every turn,
Share stories, laugh, and cry.
Be alive, do what's right,
Keep breathing, keep moving.

Oh, oh.

#Verse
Be a local,
Speak the language.
Do right at every turn,
Share stories, laugh, and cry.
Be alive,
Do what's right, keep breathing,
Keep moving.

Oh.

#Chorus
The voyage is the destination,
Where you find inspiration,
Taking the highs with the lows.
Hit "record" and out you go.

#Bridge
Oh, that is worth getting,
Won't come easy, no forgetting.
Some will come and some will go,
But follow the way,

#Verse
Give it your best, do what's right.
Pray or talk, what is the difference?
Pack up light, follow through,
Seek your purpose, seek your peace.

Through every storm,
Learn your lessons.

#Outro
Enjoy the ride or start anew.
But on this voyage,
You got to keep breathing.
