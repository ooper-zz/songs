When I hit the road,
I cast my dreams a place to roam.

Yeah, I do not know where I'm going,
But I'm ready, my feet are glowing.

The voyage is the destination,
Where you find inspiration,
Taking the highs with the lows.
Hit record and out you go.

La, la, la, la.
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.

Be a local, speak their language,
At least try.
Do right at every turn,
Share stories, laugh, and cry.
Be alive, do what's right,
Keep breathing, keep moving.

Oh, oh.

Be a local,
Speak the language.
Do right at every turn,
Share stories, laugh, and cry.
Be alive,
Do what's right, keep breathing,
Keep moving.

Oh.

The voyage is the destination,
Where you find inspiration,
Taking the highs with the lows.
Hit "record" and out you go.

Oh, that is worth getting,
Won't come easy, no forgetting.
Some will come and some will go,
But follow the way,
Give it your best, do what's right.
Pray or talk, what is the difference?
Pack up light, follow through,
Seek your purpose, seek your peace.

Through every storm,
Learn your lessons.

Enjoy the ride or start anew.
But on this voyage,
You got to keep breathing.
