[Verse 1]
We search for meaning, far and wide,
Like something slipping through our minds.
Retrace the steps, go back in time,
The truth was there, right in our eyes...

[Chorus]
We miss the signs, they're hard to see,
But what about how to save love?
K-I-S-S, keep it super simple!
One gentle touch, the heart's revealed,
Unraveling knots we kept inside.

K-I-S-S, keep it super simple!

[Verse 2]
We twist our hearts, the knots grow tight,
But one soft word can make it right.
A simple truth, no need to shout,
Love flows in when we let it out.

[Chorus][intro grand piano solo]

[Verse 1]
We search for meaning, far and wide,
Like something slipping through our minds.

[Chorus]

K-I-S-S, keep it super simple!
One gentle touch, the heart's revealed,
Letting go of knots we can't untie.

K-I-S-S, keep it super simple!

We twist our hearts, the knots grow tight,
But one soft word can make it right.
A simple truth, no need to shout,

K-I-S-S, keep it super simple!

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
It’s in the quiet, in the pause,
Where love just is, without a cause.
A single touch can mend it all,
The answer’s simpler than we thought.

[outro]
K-I-S-S, keep it simple, silly...

We miss the signs, they're hard to see,

Unraveling knots we kept inside.
