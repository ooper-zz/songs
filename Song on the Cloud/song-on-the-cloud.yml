[Chorus]
A love eternal, formed in the cloud,
A melody written with every heartbeat,
Boom, Boom, Boom, our love resounds through,
Love in the Cloud, we bridged the distance!

[Verse 1]
She brought light and colors
From the land of dreams,
And I brought my dreams and wonder
From beyond the horizon.

[Verse 2]
Hand in hand we face the world with grace,
United by a love that even time can't erase,
In the distance, our connection strengthens,
An eternal love that will never fade.

[Chorus]
A love eternal, formed in the cloud,
A melody written with every heartbeat,
Boom, Boom, Boom, our love resounds through,
Love in the Cloud, we bridged the distance!

[Bridge]
In every note of the piano, our love vibrates,
Every chord draws our beautiful story,
A symphony that time cannot erase,
An eternal love that never ceases.

[Verse 3]
With every word in this melody,
We came to know each other deeply, beyond presence,
An eternal love that never ceases,
In our hearts, it will always live.

[Outro]
Like an eternal legacy, a treasure on the path,
Our hearts resound boom, boom, boom in the cloud,
Always and forever, a divine love,
Love in the Cloud, a love like no other.

Love in the Cloud! boom, boom, boom louder now
Love in the Cloud, we're finally together!
