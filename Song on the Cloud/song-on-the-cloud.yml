[Chorus]
A love eternal, formed in the cloud,
A melody written with every heartbeat,
Boom, Boom, Boom, their love resounds,
Love in the Cloud, together they bridged the distance!

[Verse 1]
She brought light and colors
From the land of dreams,
He brought nobility and bravery
From beyond the horizon,

[Verse 2]
Hand in hand they face the world with grace,
United by a love that time cannot erase,
In the distance, their connection grows stronger,
An eternal love that will never fade.

[Chorus]
A love eternal, formed in the cloud,
A melody written with every heartbeat,
Boom, Boom, Boom, their love resounds,
Love in the Cloud, together they bridged the distance!

[Bridge]
In every note of the piano, their love vibrates,
Every chord draws their beautiful story,
A symphony that time cannot erase,
An eternal love that never ceases.

[Verse 3]
With every word in this melody,
They came to know each other deeply, beyond physical presence,
An eternal love that never ceases,
In their hearts, it will always live.

[Outro]
Like an eternal legacy, a treasure on the path,
Their love resounds in the cloud and in their hearts,
Always and forever, a divine love,
Love in the Cloud, a love like no other.
