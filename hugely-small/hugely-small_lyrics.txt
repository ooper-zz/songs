[lead in - instrumental interlude Transition]

They stand so tall casting shadows wide
Many words but little they confide
Is fear the root or something else inside?
A hollow bloom, but do we know why?
I've stared him down, the man in the mirror
Trying to change what I once held dear
When the masks begin to fall
We find the proud, we're hugely small
Hugely small, towers made of air Truth
Moves quiet, but it's always there
What holds weight won't always build a wall
Stillness speaks we hugely small The
Stars don shout but still they shine
Each step gentle and kind
What's built in care won't need a wall
The truest things are hugely small, hugely small
Soft and sincere
Truth walks lightly
Yet draws us near
In humble ground
We find it all
A quiet truth
We're hugely small
Let it be whispered, let it be known
In smallest seeds the greatest are grown
