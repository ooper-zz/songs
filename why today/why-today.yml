[Intro]
[reflective Grand Piano]

[Verse 1]
In the quiet of the night
When dreams take flight
We find our guiding light
Our mission shines so bright!

[Verse 2]
With our Kairos inside (Today)
We cast our fears aside
Doing what we know is right
Like stars in the darkened night

[Chorus]
[Significantly Rising]
Oh, we seek our truth in the silence
Heed the wisdom of the wise one [Pause]
Walking the path with guidance,
Living for a reason, today under the sun
Kairos, Why Today!

[Verse 3]
In each moment, in each breath
We're closer to our best
Feeling the heart in our chest
Living life, doing right, oh oh!

[Chorus]
[Significantly Rising]
Oh, we seek our truth in the silence
Heed the wisdom of the wise one [Pause]
Walking the path with guidance,
Living for a reason, today under the sun
Kairos, Why Today!

[Bridge]
[Crescendos Building]
Follow the whispers inside
[Start Crescendo with Strings and Percussion]
Embrace the love we feel inside
[Increase Intensity]
Hear the call like crashing tides
Kairos, Kairos
[Reach Peak Crescendo]
In faith and hope we confide
[Dynamic Crescendo with Full Orchestra]

[Verse 4]
What makes today unique?
Moments that we seek
Every action, every choice
Giving our purpose a voice

[Chorus]
[Significantly Rising]
Oh, we seek our truth in the silence
Heed the wisdom of the wise one [Pause]
Walking the path with guidance,
Living for a reason, today under the sun
Kairos, Why Today!

[Outro]
Heed the wisdom, simple and true
Live today, in all you do
Yesterday's dreams, tomorrow's scope
In todayâ€™s light, we find our hope
Kairos, Why Today!
Kairos, Kairos!

[Fade to End]
