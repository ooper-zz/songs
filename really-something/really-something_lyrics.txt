Verse 1
We were walking. Just talking.
Had never held hands or anything...
The street was quiet — no reason to rush.
Then — out of nowhere — total darkness.
And without a word...
you reached for my hand.
Why did that shake me?!
I mean… my palms were sweaty —
I was gonna reach too...
but probably for the wrong reasons.
Chorus
You didn’t think twice —
just reached for my hand.
I was fumbling, overthinking...
but you just trusted me.
And that?
That was really something...
Verse 2
Then — just like that — the lights blinked back.
And you? You let go
like it never even happened.
Laughed it off. Looked ahead.
Kept walking like always.
But me?
I was still in that second.
Still holding on — even with my hand empty.
Funny how trust shows up unannounced
No grand gesture, no perfect vows
Just fingers brushing in the dark
And somehow... I believed in us
Final Chorus
You didn’t think twice —
just reached for my hand.
I was fumbling, overthinking...
but you just needed my protection..

And that?
That was really something.

Outro 
Took months before we even kissed...
But that fateful night?
You reached out first.
Not by chance —
but part of God’s grand design.

And we can never let go.
