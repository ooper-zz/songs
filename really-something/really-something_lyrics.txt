Oh, Hm, oh, oh, oh
We were walking. Just talking
Had never held hands or anything
The street was quiet — no reason to rush
Then — out of nowhere — total darkness
And without a word
You reached for my hand
Why did that shake me?
I mean... my palms were sweaty —
I was gonna reach too
But probably for different reasons
You didn't think twice —
Just reached for my hand
I was fumbling, overthinking
But you just trusted me
And that?
That was really something
Then — just like that
The lights blinked back
And you? You let go
Like it never even happened
Laughed it off. Looked ahead
Kept walking like always
But me?
I was still in that second
Still holding on — even with my hand empty
Funny how trust shows up unannounced
No grand gesture, no perfect vows
Just fingers brushing in the dark
And somehow, I believed in us
You didn't think twice —
Just reached for my hand
I was fumbling, overthinking
But you just needed my protection
And that?
That was really something
Took months before we even kissed
But that night?
You reached first and we hold on
Even in the dark!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
That was really, really something
