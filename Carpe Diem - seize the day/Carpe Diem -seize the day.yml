[Intro]
[Soft Piano and Strings Intro]

[Chorus]
Carpe Diem, seize the day,
Live with purpose, find your way.
Each morning, sun does rise,
Today could be our prize.

[Verse 1]
A wise man spoke, make each day count,
Yesterday's dreams woven in hearts,
Tomorrow's hopes where we start,
In today’s light, we find our part.

[Chorus]
[Significantly Rising]
Carpe Diem, seize the day,
Live with purpose, find your way.
Strive each morning, sun does rise,
Today could be our prize.

[Verse 2]
Together, rhymes that make us smile,
Silent peace, listen for a while.
Solidarity, wisdom’s grace,
Solving problems, steady pace.

[Bridge]
Living in worry, past replays,
We lose beauty of precious days.
Lessons left, find,
Peace and joy, heart and mind.

[Chorus]
[Significantly Rising]
Carpe Diem, seize the day,
Live with purpose, find your way.
Strive each morning, at sun rise,
'Cause today could be our prize!

[Outro]
Heed the wisdom, simple and true,
Live today, in all you do.
Yesterday's dreams, tomorrow's scope,
In today’s light, we find our hope.

[Backup: "Carpe Diem, Seize the Day..."]
