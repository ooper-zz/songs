[Intro]
[Building Synth Intro]

[Verse 1]
A wise man spoke... make each day count,
Yesterday's dreams... woven in hearts,
Tomorrow's hopes... where we start,
In today’s light... we find our part.

[Chorus]
Carpe Diem, seize the day,
Live with purpose, find your way.
Each morning... sun does rise,
Today could be our prize.

[Verse 2]
Together... rhymes that make us smile,
Silent peace... we listen for a while.
Solidarity... wisdom’s grace,
Solving problems... steady pace.

[Chorus]
Carpe Diem, seize the day,
Live with purpose, find your way.
Strive each morning... sun does rise,
Today could be our prize.

[Bridge]
Living in worry... past replays,
We lose beauty... of precious days.
Lessons of wise man... find,
Peace and joy... heart and mind.

[Chorus]
Carpe Diem, seize the day,
Live with purpose, find your way.
Strive each morning... sun does rise,
Today could be our prize!
[Backup: "Or it could be our demise..."]
[Outro]
Heed the wisdom... simple and true,
Live today... in all you do.
Yesterday's dreams... tomorrow's scope,
In today’s light... we find our hope.

[Backup: "Find our hope..."]
[Fade to End]
