[Solo Grand Piano Intro]

Verse 1
I look at you as if weâ€™ve just met,
Our warm embrace never to forget.
A ray of light in a sky of gray,
in our embrace, we found our way.

Chorus
Today is golden, love still shines,
Through every turn, your hand with mine.
Whatever may come, whatever's been,

I see you now as I saw you then!

Verse 2
Smiles unfold like morning light,
Soft and steady, pure and bright.
No need for words, no need to chase,
Every moment still falls into place.

Chorus
Today is golden, love still shines,
Through every turn, your hand with mine.
Whatever may come, whatever's been,
I see you now as I saw you then!

Bridge
Not lost in the past, not fearing the new,
Just living the promise I made with you.

Outro
If time stands still or carries us on,
I see you now, as I saw you then...

[end]
