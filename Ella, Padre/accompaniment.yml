Genre:
Acoustic Ballad with elements of Latin pop or folk. This genre will allow the emotional depth of the lyrics to take center stage while keeping the instrumentation relatively simple and poignant.
Think along the lines of artists like Alejandro Sanz or Natalia Lafourcade, where the focus is on voice and lyrics, with gentle yet powerful musical backing.
Instrumentation:
Acoustic Guitar: A soft fingerpicked pattern or gentle strumming will give the song warmth and intimacy. It also allows the lyrics to breathe, making it perfect for storytelling.
Piano: Light piano chords can add emotional depth, especially in the chorus and bridge. The piano would provide a gentle rise in dynamics without overwhelming the vocals.
Strings (optional): A soft cello or violin could be added to the bridge or outro to bring a sense of swelling emotion, particularly when you're celebrating her strength.
Percussion: Keep it minimal—maybe just a cajón or light drums for rhythm in the chorus, with brushes or a soft snare for a laid-back vibe. This would add texture without overpowering the vocals.
Chord Progressions:
Verses: Something simple, like I-IV-I-V (in C major, this would be C-F-C-G), which keeps the focus on the story and doesn’t distract from the lyrics.
Chorus: A slightly more dramatic progression, like I-V-vi-IV (in C major, C-G-Am-F), which is a popular progression for emotional ballads.
Bridge: For contrast, you could use a minor progression, like vi-IV-I-V (Am-F-C-G), to emphasize the reflection and strength.
