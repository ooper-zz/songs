[lead in - instrumental interlude Transition]

[Verse 1]
They stand so tall, casting shadows wide  
Lots of words, but truth they can’t hide  
Fear’s the root, but what's the seed?  
Arrogance blooms, but it's hollow indeed

[break]

[pre-chorus]
When all is said, when the masks come down  
Truth whispers low, but it carries the crown

[break]

[Chorus]
Hugely small, a fairyfly on the wall  
Shadows tall, but we’re nothing at all  
Fear and pride, they hide inside  
But at the end of it all, they're hugely small

[Verse 2]
Quick to judge, they point and they belittle  
Is it fear they refuse to unveil?  
They ramble in dissonance, 
disguised as a policy or a riddle...

But in their riddle, their flaws prevail!

[Verse 3]
They draft their policies, all straight and narrow  
But on the low road, envy takes the wheel  
Driven by jealousy, they sharpen the arrow  
Aiming for others, but they’re the ones who’ll feel

[prelude]

[Bridge]
Mind the reflection; once you look in the mirror  
Seek the heart, not the mask you wear  
In the mirror, your good angel stings like a bee  
For in the end, only truth sets us free

For in the end, only truth sets us free...
Sets us free...

[break]

[fade out]
Claim your claim, when you've got something real...
