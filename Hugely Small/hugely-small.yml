[lead in - instrumental interlude Transition]

[Verse 1]
They stand so tall, casting shadows wide  
Lots of words, but truth they can’t hide  
Fear’s the root, but what's the seed?  
Arrogance blooms, but it's hollow indeed

[pre-chorus]
When all is said, when the masks come down  
Truth whispers low, but it carries the crown!

[Chorus]
Hugely small, a fairyfly on the wall  
Shadows tall, but we’re nothing at all  
Fear and pride, they hide inside  
But at the end of it all, they're hugely small

[break]

[Verse 2]
Quick to judge, they point and they belittle  
Is it fear they refuse to unveil?  
They ramble in dissonance, 
disguised as a policy or a riddle...

But in their riddle, their flaws prevail.
the low road is a quick ride to  doomland!

[prelude]

[Bridge]
Mind the reflection; once you look in the mirror  
Seek the heart, not the mask you wear  
In the mirror, your good angel stings like a bee  
For in the end, only truth sets us free

For in the end, only truth sets us free...
Sets us free...

[fade out]
Claim your claim, when you've got something real...
