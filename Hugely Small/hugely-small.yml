[Verse 1]
They stand so tall, casting shadows wide  
Big words on their lips, but truth they can’t hide  
Fear’s the root, jealousy’s the seed  
Arrogance blooms, but it's hollow indeed

[pre-chorus]
When all is said, when the masks come down  
Truth whispers low, but it carries the crown
[Chorus]

Hugely small, a fairyfly on the wall  
Shadows tall, but we’re nothing at all  
Fear and pride, they hide inside  
But at the end of it all, they're hugely small

[Verse 2]
Quick to judge, they point and they belittle  
Is it fear they refuse to unveil?  
They ramble in dissonance, disguised as a riddle  
But in their riddle, their flaws prevail

[prelude]

[Bridge]
Mind the reflection; once you look in the mirror  
Seek the heart, not the mask you wear  
In the mirror, your good angel stings like a bee  
For in the end, only truth sets us free

For in the end, only truth sets us free...
Sets us free...
