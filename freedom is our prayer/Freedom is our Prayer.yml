[Chorus 1]
I will, we will, stand together,
Pray for our country, now and forever.
I will, we will, lift our voice,
For our nation, let's make the choice.

Freedom is our prayer, America our surname!

[Verse 1]
Brother, pray for our country,
A plea I didn’t foresee,
From my twin of hearts,
Two souls, one choice, one decree.

[Verse 2]
Two creeds, yet "Freedom," we pray,
One prayer, united, we run free.
Dictator’s grip, a dark embrace,
A country "Under God," now set ablaze.

[Pre-Chorus]
Laws changed, a cruel reign,
Our souls sincere, his soul in vain.
Different seeds, one parent tree,
In this prayer, we find the light.

[Bridge]
Two stand as one, one heart, one sky,
Different backgrounds, different creeds.
This sky we share, must stay blue,
Our nation, under God, stays true.

[Chorus 2]
I will, we will, stand together,
Pray for our country, now and forever.
I will, we will, lift our voice,
For our nation, let's make the choice.

Freedom is our prayer, America our surname!

[Outro]
Brother, let's pray for our country,
With hope and faith, eternally.
Twins of soul, in this we trust,
For our nation, it's us or bust.

[Coda]
A nation that bears a surname,
"America" must thrive.
In our hearts and prayers,
United will survive.
