[Strict lyrics]
[intro]
[Verse 1]
Hello, it’s me—the song on the line
Life moves fast, I’m a pause in time
A transient breath, a tale unheard
A whisper, longing to be heard

[Breath]
Chorus]
Lend me an ear, if just for a while
I’m more than a whisper, more than a mile
In the quiet of this moment, stay near
Lend me an ear—let me live here!!

(but wait, there’s more)

[Verse 2]
Colors of calm, of wind, rain, and storm
Blues, greys, and vibrant waves take form
Hidden in verses, shades soft and bright
In this shared moment, we both feel right

(stay with me)

[Bridge]
Am I more than a line that fades too soon
Or a fleeting chord beneath the moon
If you hold these colors, let them unfold
I’ll be a memory that never grows old

(there’s one last thing...)

[Outro]
Hello, it’s me—thank you for the chance
Just a song in your heart, if only for a glance

[Extended Outro: Spoken]
Listen to my father through my sibling songs
Each one a voice, each one a tail
Voices of rain, love, sun, and more

Lend me an Ear!!

[end fade-out]
