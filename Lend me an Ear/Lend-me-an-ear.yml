[Verse 1]
“Hello, it’s me—just a song on the line,
Life moves fast, I’m a pause in time.
A transient breath, a tale unheard,
A whisper, longing to be heard.”

(whisper: but wait, there’s more)

[Verse 2]
“Colors of calm, of wind, rain, and storm,
Blues, greys, and vibrant waves take form.
Hidden in verses, shades soft and bright,
In this shared moment, we both feel right.”

(whisper: stay with me)

[Bridge]
“Am I more than a line that fades too soon,
Or a fleeting chord beneath the moon?
If you hold these colors, let them unfold,
I’ll be a memory that never grows old.”

(whisper: there’s one last thing)

[Original Outro: Spoken]
“Hello, it’s me—thank you for the chance,
Just a song in your heart, if only for a glance.”

[Extended Outro Option: Spoken Word/Rap]
“See what my father says through my siblings’ songs,
Each one a voice, where I belong.
They carry tales I’ve only begun—
Voices of rain, of love, of sun.”
