[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hello, it’s me—the song on the line
Life moves fast, I’m a pause in time
A transient breath, a tale unheard
A whisper, longing to be heard

[Chorus]
Lend me an ear, if just for a while
I’m more than a whisper, more than a sound
In the calm of this moment, stay near
Lend me an ear, let me stay awhile!!

(and what about you?)
[Verse 2]
Calm as the wind, or rain’s gentle song
Emotions that rise, both steady and strong
In spirit of lyrics, they come alive
In this moment, everything’s right!!

[short breath]

[Chorus]
Lend me an ear, if just for a while
I’m more than a whisper, more than a sound
In the calm of this moment, stay near
Lend me an ear, let me stay awhile!!

(but wait, there’s more)
[Bridge]
Am I more than a line that fades too soon
Or a fleeting chord beneath the moon
Hold these feelings, let them rise
I’ll be a memory that never grows old

(there’s one last thing...)

[Outro]
Hello, it’s me—thank you for the bent ear
I'm a new song in your heart, if only for a glance

(stay in touch...)

[clearly Spoken]
Stay tuned for my siblings' songs,  
Each one a voice, each one a tale
Voices of faith, rain, love, sun, and more...

Lend me an ear!!
Lend me an ear...

[End fade-out]
