[Verse 1]:

Chasing sunsets, new milestones
Meeting strangers, stories told
Laughter echoes, bonfire nights
Connections made along the way

Got my cam, and here I go!

[Pre-Chorus]:
Highs and lows, we roam
Every new place, a new home
Every face and every smile
The journey, your eyes and hearts,

All worthwhile...

[Chorus]:
Sharing rides, sharing dreams
From close ties to drifting apart
In every laugh, in every tear
The heart is what I call home

Always connected! Oh, oh!

[Verse 2]:
Ancient paths, stories told
Footsteps echo, brave and bold
Tracing history, new trails unfold
In this journey, a new quest

[Bridge]:

Every sunset paints a scene
Moments fleeting, yet serene
Laughter rings, nights unseen
In these bonds, we find our dream

[Chorus]:
Sharing rides, sharing dreams
From close ties to drifting apart
In every laugh, in every tear
The heart is what I call home

Always connected! Oh, oh!

[Outro]:
Journeys end, but bonds remain
Memories linger, like the rain
As we part, one thing's clear
Your heart, your eyes, is my gear!
