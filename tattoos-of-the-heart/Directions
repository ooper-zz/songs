Modern Pop song with a clear, upbeat, and emotive main vocal. Backing vocals should provide harmony during the chorus and post-chorus. Use a moderate to fast tempo with bright instrumental tones and synth pop elements. Incorporate a clap stomp rhythm during the chorus. Build up the percussion subtly during the pre-chorus and use a crescendo to lead into the chorus. Ensure dynamic contrast throughout the song to maintain energy and engagement.
