[Chorus]
On the journey to myself, didn’t mean to hide,
Through the highs and the lows, only my bike to ride.
The wheels of my Harley just kept turning,
handlebars stopped steering.

[Verse]
The voices called, but I stayed away,
Chasing dreams that slipped away.
In every mile, the memories grew,
But the roads never led back to you.

[Chorus]
On the journey to myself, didn’t mean to hide,
Through the highs and the lows, only my bike to ride.
The wheels of my Harley just kept turning,
handlebars stopped steering.

[Bridge]
A voice once hailed, now stale,
Through it all, It was heads or tail.
Time rolls on, the music fades,
Somewhere out there, I lost my way.

Outro]
The road ahead is still unknown,
But love remains, it’s what I’ve sown.
Through every breath, the voice will stay,
A light of hope to guide the way.
