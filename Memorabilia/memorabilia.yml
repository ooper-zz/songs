[Chorus]
If I could walk the streams of time,
Where every second flows in line,
a ripple through the fabric of time,
Memorabilia, where moments still align.

A visit, if only to hold your hand in mine.

[inhale]

[Verse 1]
In quiet halls of time I roam,
Your smile, a beacon leading home.
Only to wake, the visit gone,
A toll I pay in moments drawn.

[inhale]

[Chorus]
If I could walk the streams of time,
Where every second flows in line,
a ripple through the fabric of time,
Memorabilia, where moments still align.

[inhale]

[Verse 2]
Through laughter shared and lessons gone,
Truths unfold as I move on.
Your gentle hand, a light so near,
Guiding me to what’s now clear.

[Interlude]
(Instrumental pause)

[Bridge]
In the end, I count each blessing gained,
Every turn, a lesson claimed.
Through dreams, both great and small,
I find the strength to face it all.

[inhale]

[Outro]
Thank you for your light, so strong and brave.
I hope my love, through time, will stay—
A part of you, forever in some way.

[end fade out]
