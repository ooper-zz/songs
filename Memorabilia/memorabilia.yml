[grand piano intro]
[Verse 1]
In quiet halls of time I roam,
Your smile, a beacon leading home.
Only to wake, my visit's gone,
paid in the currency of time.

[inhale]

[Big Chorus]
If I could walk the streams of time,
Where every second flows in line,
a ripple through the fabric of time,
Memorabilia, if only once again,
hold your hand in mine.

Oh-Oh-Oh
Memorabilia!

[inhale]

[Verse 2]
Through laughter shared and lessons gone,
Quality time, a candle’s light,
nostalgically held so dear,
destined to pass on, forevermore.

[Chorus]
If I could walk the streams of time,
Where every second flows in line,
a ripple through the fabric of time,
Memorabilia, if only once again,
hold your hand in mine...

Memorabilia!

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
I count each blessing gained,
in every turn, a lesson claimed.
Through dreams, never small,
I find the strength to face it all.

[inhale]

[Outro]
Thank you for your light, so strong and brave.
I hope my love, through time, will stay—
A part of you, forever in some small way...
forever in some small way!!

[end fade out]
