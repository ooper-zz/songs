In quiet halls of time I roam,
Your smile, a beacon leading home.
Only to wake, my visit's gone,
paid with the currency of time.

If I could walk the streams of time,
Where every second flows in line,
a ripple through the fabric of time,
Memorabilia, if only once again,
hold your hand in mine...oh-oh-oh!

Memorabilia!!!!

Through laughter shared and lessons learned,,
Quality time, a candleâ€™s light,
nostalgically held so dear,
destined to pass on, forever more.

If I could walk the streams of time,
Where every second flows in line,
a ripple through the fabric of time,
Memorabilia, if only once again,
hold your hand in mine...

Memorabilia!!!!

I count each blessing gained,
in every turn, a lesson claimed.
Through dreams, never small,
