[Verse 1]
In quiet halls of time I roam,
Your smile, a beacon leading home.
Only to wake, my visit's gone,
A toll in moments paid.

[inhale]

[Big Chorus]
If I could walk the streams of time,
Where every second flows in line,
a ripple through the fabric of time,
Memorabilia, if only to once again,
hold your hand in mine!!

[inhale]

[Verse 2]
Through laughter shared and lessons gone,
Truths unfold as I move on.
Your gentle hand, a light so near,
Moments that are now so dear.

[Chorus]
If I could walk the streams of time,
Where every second flows in line,
a ripple through the fabric of time,
Memorabilia, if only to once again,
hold your hand in mine!!

hold your hand in mine!!

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
In the end, I count each blessing gained,
Every turn, a lesson claimed.
Through dreams, both great and small,
I find the strength to face it all.

[inhale]

[Outro]
Thank you for your light, so strong and brave.
I hope my love, through time, will stay—
A part of you, forever in some way...
forever in some way...

[end fade out]
