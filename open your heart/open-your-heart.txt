[Verse]
Open your heart feel the light
Dormant sparks ready to ignite
There's a world to explore tonight
Inspiration takes its flight

[Verse 2]
Go with the flow let it guide
Lightning hidden deep inside
No more shadows where you hide
So much more beyond the tide

[Chorus]
Open your heart and see
Light within sets you free
So much more than we believe
Come alive just let it be

[Verse 3]
Dreams are waiting just for you
Dormant powers breaking through
Every moment feels so new
Inspiration paints the view

[Chorus]
Open your heart and see
Light within sets you free
So much more than we believe
Come alive just let it be

[Bridge]
Feel the rhythm let it go
Heartbeats rising high and low
Inspiration starts to flow
In this moment let it show
