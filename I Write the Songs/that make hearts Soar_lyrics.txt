[intro]
[grand piano]

[Verse 1]
I write the songs that make hearts soar,
Like waves that find the shore,
When they collide, melodies rise,
Dreams in the wake, they touch the skies.

[Chorus]
Them waves, let them flow,
From the heart, stories grow,
Let them crash, let them roll,
Feel the rhythm in the soul.

I write the songs that make hearts soar.

[Verse 2]
Ocean sprays, lines break free,
Like a kiss on the cheek,
Through tempests and calm seas,
Every lyric craves for more.

[Chorus]
Them waves, let them flow,
From the heart, stories grow,
Let them crash, let them roll,
Feel the rhythm in the soul.

I write the songs that make hearts soar!

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Every note, every line,
In waves, emotions shine,
Like currents, let them go,
Deep inside, let them grow.

[Outro]
Ride them waves, let them crash,
Heart and soul, in every splash,
Lyrics flow, like the sea,
In the surf, always be.

I write the songs that make hearts soar.

Let's get started: (What does your heart's wave say?)
