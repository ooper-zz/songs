Verse 1:
In the glow of an evening, under amber skies,
There's a tale to (G) tell, where the true heart lies.
With a whisper of wood, and a carve of care,
He held onto a dream, in the cool night air.

Chorus:
Amber, oh Amber, in the twilight still shines,
Under stars that speak, in a farewell night.
A purity unbroken, in the fall of time.

Chorus:
Amber, oh Amber, with a light so fine,
A silent promise, in the evening's decline.
In the shadows of love, where the quiet hears,
Amber, a memory, through the passing years.

Bridge:
In the whispers of leaves and the chill of the breeze,
He leaves a farewell, with the greatest of ease.
With the blues of a goodbye, where themtwilight bends,
He walks away, into the dimming night.

Outro:
In the amber twilight, where the dreams may roam,
He finds his peace, in the letting go.
With a love that only was, in the fading light,
Amber, it lit the whole night so bright.
