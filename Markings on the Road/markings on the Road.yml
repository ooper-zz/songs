[begin]
[Lead in - solo piano interlude Transition]

Markings on the road...

[very short pause]

[Verse 1]
Out for a stroll, geared up and all,
Cement beneath my feet,
Each step a question, each turn...a choice,
yet road markings blur the mind.

[short pause]
[Verse 2]
Markings lead, but do they know,
The paths where we should go?
Lines shift as we walk by,
Questions hold the key.

[Chorus]
Markings on the road, where hearts and minds debate,
A vanishing point unseen,
Cement cracks—doom or change,
Then we close our eyes, 
do we see beyond the point? 

Markings on the road! Oh, Oh!

[interlude solo piano]

[Bridge]
In the silence of the roads we walk,
Echoes of our thoughts—do they talk?
The truth we seek in cracks and lines,
Is it hidden, or a sign of times?

[Chorus]
Markings on the road, where hearts and minds debate,
A vanishing point unseen,
Cement cracks—doom or change,
Then we close our eyes, 
do we see beyond the point? 

Markings on the road! oh, oh

[Outro]
Markings fade, but echoes stay,
Do we see beyond today?

Markings on the road....
[end]
