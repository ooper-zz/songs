[Intro Grand piano]

[Short Breath]

[Verse 1]
Set in place, strong and steady,
Layer by layer, built to carry,
Through sun’s heat and winter’s chill,
Standing firm, unbroken will.

Even a brick wants to be something more...

[Short Breath]

[Chorus]
Be the brick, hold up the weight,
Built to stand, no fear of fate,
More than clay in designer’s hand,
A strength that rises, it transcends.
So do not despair, when life’s too thick

Be the brick!

[Short Breath]

[Verse 2]
Bound by purpose, laid with care,
A part of something strong and rare,
In designer’s hand, the vision grows,
Each piece a story, no one knows.

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Look closely, each brick stands apart,
Colors, shapes—a work of art,
Aligned in purpose, side by side,
Uniquely designed, none can hide.

[Final Chorus]
Be the brick, hold up the weight,
Built to stand, no fear of fate,
More than clay in designer’s hand,
A strength that rises, it transcends.
So do not despair, when life’s too thick,
Be the brick!

[Outro]
Be the brick…
Be the brick…
