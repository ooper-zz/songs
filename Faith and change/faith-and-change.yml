[verse 1]
I know you love me and I love you too
But this merry-go-round is making me blue
The words you quote are children of yours

I feel like an ant, antennas curled up tight
I no longer know where I’m going, out of sight
Except out of the hole we crawled
With a one-way ticket to nowhere land

[chorus]
I was hoping to fall in love again
Hoping to find the missing link
Promises made, promises broken
And still, no changes, just more chains

Don’t we know where we came from?
How do we know where we’re going?
Ohhhh, we’re just drifting
Ohhhh, in this endless loop

Faith and change, we need to find
Faith and change, to break the bind
Faith and change, to see us through
Faith and change, for me and you

[verse 2]
What will it take to break the chain,
Of going back to the past and then again?
Yet here we are, unable to solve the riddle
More by prayer than by faith, stuck in the middle
Ohhhh
Ohhhh

[bridge]
Finding a path, keeping the faith
Praying and hoping, each and every day
But I gotta see the promised changes
To endure it all, to make me stay

Keeping the faith, praying strong
Trying so hard, it's been so long
Gotta see the changes, see them through
To endure this love, and stay with you

[outro]
Finding a path, keeping the faith
Praying and hoping, each and every day
But I gotta see the promised changes
To endure it all, to make me stay

Keeping the faith, praying strong
Trying so hard, it's been so long
Gotta see the changes, see them through
To endure this love, and stay with you
