[Verse 1]
Reason speaks soft, like a whispering flute
It paints, in multiple colors tonight
But my heart beats wild, like a drum in the night
Lost in the music of love

[Chorus]
Reason builds walls, heart breaks through
One holds tight, one runs loose
Do I stay or chase the light?
Who will win this fight tonight?

Listen to the tone of the heart...

[Verse 2]
Doubt lingers like a shadow inside
Logic warns me, but love won’t hide
Do I keep quiet just to keep the peace?
Or take a chance and risk the fall?

[Chorus]
Reason builds walls, heart breaks through
One holds tight, one runs loose
Do I stay or chase the light?
Who will win the battle tonight?
Ahh, that's the tone of my heart...

[Bridge]
Logic builds walls, strong and tall
Keeps me safe but hides it all
But the heart has wings, it jumps, it flies
It doesn’t stop to wonder why

Listen to the tone of the heart...
