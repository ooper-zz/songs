[Verse]
Hand in hand we fly
Moonlight on our side
No clock, for all time
Just you and I

[iterlude] 

[Verse 2]
Moments softly felt
Forever, how we do time
Whispers in the night
Together just so right

[Chorus]
Slow dancing through time
Leave timekeeping behind
Our moments aligned
Our dreams come alive

[Verse 3]
Stars up in the skies
Reflected in your eyes
One heartbeat, one pulse
In this dance, for sure

[interlude]

[Bridge]
Hold me closely
Lose all fear
In this timeless space
It's our own place

[Chorus]
Slow dancing through time
Leave timekeeping behind
Our moments aligned
Our dreams come alive
