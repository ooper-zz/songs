[Short Piano Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
In the dawn of thought, where shadows play,
A Spitha shines and lights the way,
New ideas bloom in open minds,
Whispers of wonder, undefined.

[Pre-Chorus]
From a spark, a flame, a burning fire,
Dreams take flight, lift us higher!
Peace and rage in a dance so grand,
On the stage of life, hand in hand.
A new Spitha, a new spark!

[Chorus]
Spitha, the spark in us, a gift so true,
Guiding us through, making all things new,
Oh-oh, in the heart of living, a sacred key,
Oh-oh, unlocking paths to what we can't see.
Spitha, Spitha, our sacred key!

[Verse 2]
From old times, a purpose shines,
Every soul with dreams aligns,
In Platoâ€™s world, we seek the light,
Chasing shadows through the night.

[Pre-Chorus]
From a spark, a flame, a burning fire,
Dreams take flight, lift us higher,
Peace and rage in a dance so grand,
On the stage of life, hand in hand.
A new Spitha, Write it down!


[Chorus]
Spitha, the spark in us, a gift so true,
Guiding us through, making all things new,
Oh-oh, in the heart of living, a sacred key,
Oh-oh, unlocking paths to what we can't see.
Spitha, the spark, it's in us!

[Bridge]
A gift from above, we understand,
Guiding our hearts, holding our hand,
Reason and faith, they guide our way,
In every night, there is a day.

[Chorus]
Spitha, the spark in us, a gift so true,
Guiding us through, making all things new,
Oh-oh, in the heart of living, a sacred key,
Oh-oh, unlocking paths to what we can't see.

[Outro]
From a whisper to a thunder sound,
Ideas lift us, never let us down,
Oh-oh, in the thread of life, forever spread,
Spitha, the spark in us, always ahead.
Spitha, a gift for you and me!
you and me, oh oh oh
