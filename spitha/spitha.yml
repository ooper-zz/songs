[clean crescendo Piano Intro]

[Verse 1]
In the dawn of thought, where shadows play,
A Spitha shines and lights the way,
New ideas bloom in open minds,
Whispers of wonder, undefined.

[Pre-Chorus]
From a spark, a flame, a burning fire,
Dreams take flight, lift us higher!
Peace and rage in a dance so grand,
On the stage of life, hand in hand.
Spitha, an new Idea, a new spark!

[Chorus]
Spitha, the spark in us, a gift so true,
Guiding us through, making all things new,
Oh-oh, in the heart of living, a sacred key,
Oh-oh, unlocking paths to what we can't see.
Spitha, the Idea, our sacred key!

[Verse 2]
From old times, a purpose shines,
Every soul with dreams aligns,
In Plato’s world, we seek the light,
Chasing shadows through the night.

[Verse 3]
Love, music, art, tech, and oh, war,
Ideas that shape us, near and far,
Science, faith, dreams that soar,
From the past to who we are.

[Pre-Chorus]
From a spark, a flame, a burning fire,
Dreams take flight, lift us higher,
Peace and rage in a dance so grand,
On the stage of life, hand in hand.
A new Spitha, an Idea, write it down!

[Chorus]
Spitha, the spark in us, a gift so true,
Guiding us through, making all things new,
Oh-oh, in the heart of living, a sacred key,
Oh-oh, unlocking paths to what we can't see.
Spitha, the Idea, our sacred key!

[Bridge]
A gift from above, we understand,
Guiding our hearts, holding our hand,
Reason and faith, they guide our way,
In every night, there is a day.

[Big Finish]
When we come together, our dreams take flight,
From the pyramids to the moon’s bright light,
Oh-oh, in the heart of wonder, we ignite,
Always more than alright, narrowing the distance, our guiding light.

[Chorus]
Spitha, the spark in us, a gift so true,
Guiding us through, making all things new,
Oh-oh, in the heart of living, a sacred key,
Oh-oh, unlocking paths to what we can't see.
Spitha, the Idea, our sacred key!

[Outro]
From a whisper to a thunder sound,
Ideas lift us, never let us down,
Oh-oh, in the thread of life, forever spread,
Spitha, the spark in us, always ahead.
Spitha, a gift for you and me!
By you and me, oh oh oh.
