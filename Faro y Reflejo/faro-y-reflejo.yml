[chorus]
In the tapestry of my days, each thread you weave is gold,
In whispers, laughter, and silent ways, stories of love untold.
You're the compass when I'm lost, the strength when I am weak,
In every cost and every cross, it's your wisdom that I seek.
Mirrors of my heart, in you, life's finest art,
In the roles you play, in your own unique way,
You guide me through the night into the light of day.

[chorus]
"Las Mujeres en Mi Vida", melodía de verdad,
En cada lucha, en alegrías, su amor siempre brillará.
Estrellas guías en mi noche, en ustedes mi mundo resplandece,
"Las Mujeres en Mi Vida", en cada reto, en cada quehacer.
En su risa, en su llanto, en cada instante, cerca o lejos,
Son las historias que más canto, mi faro y mi reflejo.
