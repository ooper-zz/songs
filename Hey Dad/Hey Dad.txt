[verse]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, can you hear?
I'm right here, it's me,
Hey Dad, hey Dad, still laying hear,
But I am back, no more fear.

[chorus]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, in my deepest dreams,
I thought heard you,
Now those dreams are true.
I know you were next to me, all along
No worries, I'm bent up, but I'm back!

[verse]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, through the haze,
I felt your touch, your gentle ways.
Hey Dad, hey Dad, through all the pain,
You were there, kept me safe.

[chorus]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, in my deepest dreams,
I thought heard you,
Now those dreams are true.
I know you were next to me, all along
No worries, I'm bent up, but I'm back!

[bridge]
Through the silence, through the night,
You were my guiding light.
Now we have a chance to start,
To heal the wounds, mend the heart.

[verse]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, I heard you cry,
You tried to give me my first sip of water in a long time.
Hey Dad, hey Dad, you got yelled at but I love you for trying,
Hey Dad, hey Dad, we'll keep on fighting.

[chorus]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, in my deepest dreams,
I thought heard you,
Now those dreams are true.
I know you were next to me, all along
No worries, I'm bent up, but I'm back!

[outro]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, let's begin,
A new chapter, where we win.
Hey Dad, hey Dad, hand in hand,
Together, we will stand.
Hey Dad, hey Dad, it's me,
Same old me, but I'm back.
