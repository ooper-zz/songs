[I] Hey Dad, hey Dad, [vi] can you hear?
[IV] I'm right here, it's me, [V] standing near.
[I] Hey Dad, hey Dad, [vi] it’s all so clear,
[IV] I am back, [V] no more fear.

[I] Hey Dad, hey Dad, [vi] in my deepest dreams I saw you,

[I] Hey Dad, hey Dad, [vi] it’s our time,
[IV] I am back, [V] so much to make up.
