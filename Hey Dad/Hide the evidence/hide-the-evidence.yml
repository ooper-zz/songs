[intro]
[acoustic guitar] 

[Verse 1]
Yellow blooms in June,
A bouquet for his little girl. And one to go for Mom too.
“We’re not supposed to cut those, Dad” she giggled.
“It's fine, they're just wildflowers” dad claimed.

[Verse 2]

Back at the cabin,
Godfather with cocoa came by,
“Did you cut those poppies?”
“It’s illegal, you know” he dared!
Oh, Oh

[Chorus]

Hide the evidence, into the fire!
Laughter fills the room, hearts inspired.
Daughter's giggle, father's grin,
Precious moments live on, deep within.
¡Ay, ay, ay! Hide the evidence!

[Bridge]

In simple moments, we find our way,
Laughing together, at the end of the day.
so much to learn both ways,
Her little hand in mine, the love forever will burn.

[Chorus]

Hide the evidence, into the fire!
Laughter fills the room, hearts inspired.
Daughter's giggle, father's grin,
Precious moments live on, deep within.
¡Ay, ay, ay! Hide the evidence!

[Outro]

California poppies, state law!
As for dad, next stop: Hotel California,
Where he may never leave! ¡Ay, ay, ay Dad!
