[intro\
[acoustic guitar] 

[Verse 1]

Yellows bloom in June,
A bouquet for my little girl, and one for Mom too!
“We’re not supposed to cut those”, she giggled.
“It's fine, their just wildflowers,” I claimed.

[Verse 2]

Back at the cabin,
Godfather with cocoa came by,
“Did you cut those poppies?”
“It’s illegal, you know”, he dared.

[Chorus]

Hide the evidence, into the fire!
Laughter fills the room, hearts inspired.
Daughter's giggle, father's grin,
Precious moments live on, deep within.

[Bridge]

In simple moments, we find our way,
Laughing together, at the end of the day.
so much to learn, both ways,
Her little hand in mine, the love, forever will burn.

[Chorus]
Hide the evidence, into the fire!
Laughter fills the room, hearts inspired.
Daughter's giggle, father's grin,
These moments will live on, deep within.

[Outro]

California poppies, state law.
As for dad, Hotel California next stop
Where he may never leave! aahhh
