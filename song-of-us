Verse 1
why is it, that winning means somebody has to lose?
when life is full of colors, not just one or two
don't you know, we are all notes in a song we choose
and as keys and chords in a piano, we all shine through

Pre-Chorus
A wise man said, "Love your neighbor"
yet we're too busy, keeping favor...

Chorus
Harmony is more than just a tune,
and we're all keys laying on a piano
so let's play in tune, and let it flow 
You see, Harmony's the song of us...

Pre-Chorus
the wise man gave so much, asking for so little,
why can't you and I give back and solve the riddle?

Chorus
Harmony, can't you see, it's more than a tune.
We're all keys on one piano.
If one's off, we all lose.
If we are all tuned, nobody has to lose.
Let it play, let it flow, in The Song of Us...
...he ONE Song of Us...

Outro
The Song of Us, it starts in the heart
In this life's song, let love be your part
in The Song of Us? in The ONE Song of Us?

...What part will you play?
