The Song Of Us Long version

Verse 1
<!-- The message here is about questioning the competitive nature of society and how it often leads to inequality. -->
🎵 Why do we climb, just to push others down? 🎵 Why's it to win, someone has to lose? 🎵 We're all notes in a song, can't you see? 🎵 When one's off, we all lose the beat.

Pre-Chorus
<!-- This section introduces the teachings of a good man (implicitly Jesus) as a contrast to society's focus on self-interest. -->
🎵 A wise man said, "Love your neighbor" 🎵 But we're too busy, keeping score.

Chorus
<!-- The chorus emphasizes the idea of harmony and unity, comparing society to a piano where each key (person) matters. -->
🎵 Harmony, can't you see, it's more than a tune. 🎵 We're all keys on one piano. 🎵 If one's off, we all lose. 🎵 Let's get back to basics, find our true song.

Verse 2
<!-- This verse brings in the concept of storytelling, emphasizing that life isn't just black and white. It also introduces the idea of complementary colors to symbolize how people can bring out the best in each other. -->
🎵 In every story, a hero, a foe, 🎵 But life's full of colors, not just one or two. 🎵 Like red and green, we can shine, 🎵 When we help each other, we all do fine.

Pre-Chorus
<!-- Reiterates the idea that a wise man (implicitly Jesus) gave of himself for others, asking why we can't do the same. -->
🎵 He gave so much, asking for so little, 🎵 Can't we give back, solve this riddle?

Chorus
<!-- Repeats the chorus to emphasize the main message of unity and harmony. -->
🎵 Harmony, can't you see, it's more than a tune. 🎵 We're all keys on one piano. 🎵 If one's off, we all lose. 🎵 Let's get back to basics, find our true song.

Bridge
<!-- This section combines the ideas of storytelling and logic to emphasize that kindness is both emotionally and logically the right path. -->
🎵 From heroes to colors, it all makes sense, 🎵 Kindness is logical, let's not be dense. 🎵 A wise man showed us, but do we even care? 🎵 What part will you play, in this tale we share?

Outro
<!-- The outro wraps up the song by stating that following the path of goodness is not just spiritually right but also logically sound. -->
🎵 The beauty in life, in every face, 🎵 Isn't it clear, love's the only place? 🎵 It's not just feeling, it's also smart, 🎵 In this life's song, let love be your part.
