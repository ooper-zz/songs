[verse]
why is it that winning means somebody has to lose
   when life is full of colors, not just one or two?
Don't you know, we're all notes in a song we choose,
   and as keys and chords in a piano, we all shine through?

[pre-chorus]
A wise man said, "Love your neighbor",
yet we're too busy keeping favor...

[chorus]
Harmony, it's more than just a tune
We're all just keys lying on a piano,
so let's play in tune, let it flow!
'cause Harmony's the song of us...

[verse 2]
Why is it that battles rage when peace could be the prize?
When every key on a piano can make a melody rise?
Don't you see, rage's just a displeasing chord we despise,
while a song on a piano can wipe tears from our eyes?

[pre-chorus]
A wise man said, "Turn the other cheek,"
yet we're too quick to judge, too slow to speak...

[chorus]
Harmony, it's more than just a tune.
We're all just keys lying on a piano,
so let's play in tune, let it flow!
'cause Harmony's the song of us...

[pre-chorus]
He gave so much, asking for so little,
why can't we give back and solve the riddle?

[chorus]
Harmony, it's more than just a tune.
We're all just keys lying on a piano,
so let's play in tune, let it flow!
'cause Harmony's the song of us...

[outro]
What part will you play?
