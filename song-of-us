Verse 1
Why must one win, just to make another lose?
We're all notes in a song, to choose.
Life's full of colors, not just one or two.
Like keys and chords, we all shine through
In the Song of Us.

Pre-Chorus
A wise man said, "Love your neighbor"
But we're too busy, chasing favor.

Chorus
Harmony, can't you see, it's more than a tune.
We're all keys on one piano.
If one's off, we all lose.
Let it be, let it flow, nobody has to lose.
Let it play, let it glow, in The Song of Us

Pre-Chorus
He gave so much, asking for so little,
Can't we give back, solve this riddle?

Chorus
Harmony, can't you see, it's more than a tune.
We're all keys on one piano.
If one's off, we all lose.
Let it be, let it flow, nobody has to lose.
Let it play, let it glow, in The Song of Us

Outro
The beauty in life, in every face,
Isn't it clear, love's the only place?
In this life's song, let love be your part,
The Song of Us, it starts in the heart.

What part will you play, in The Song of Us?
