Verse 1
why is it that winning means somebody has to lose
   when life is full of colors, not just one or two?
Don't you know, we're all notes in a song we choose,
   and as keys and chords in a piano, we all shine through?

Pre-Chorus
A wise man said, "Love your neighbor",
yet we're too busy keeping favor...

Chorus
Harmony, it's more than just a tune.
We're all just keys laying on a piano,
so let's play in tune, let it flow!
'cause Harmony's the song of us...

Pre-Chorus
He gave so much, asking for so little,
why can't we give back and solve the riddle?

Chorus
Harmony, it's more than just a tune.
We're all just keys laying on a piano,
so let's play in tune, let it flow!
'cause Harmony's the song of us...

Outro
The Song of Us, it starts in the heart
In this life's song, let love be our part
in The Song of Us? in The ONE Song of Us?

...What part will you play?
