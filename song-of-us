Verse 1
<!-- The message here is about questioning the competitive nature of society and how it often leads to inequality. -->
Why's it, that to win, someone has to lose?â€¨Can't you see, weâ€™re all notes in a song
when one is off, it goes out of tune

Pre-Chorus
<!-- This section introduces the teachings of a good man (implicitly Jesus) as a contrast to society's focus on self-interest. -->
A wise man once said, "Love your neighbor"
But Instead of loving one another
we're too busy keeping scores

Chorus
<!-- The chorus emphasizes the idea of harmony and unity, comparing society to a piano where each key (person) matters. -->
Itâ€™s all written.
We're all keys on one piano
If one's off, we all lose.
Let's do what's right, in the Song of Us.

Verse 2
<!-- This verse brings in the concept of storytelling, emphasizing that life isn't just black and white. It also introduces the idea of complementary colors to symbolize how people can bring out the best in each other. -->
ðŸŽµ Life is full of colors, not just one or two.â€¨ðŸŽµ Like red and green, we can shine,â€¨ðŸŽµ When we help each other, we all do fine.

Pre-Chorus
<!-- Reiterates the idea that a wise man (implicitly Jesus) gave of himself for others, asking why we can't do the same. -->
He gave so much, asking for so little,
He played his part, in a selfless tune,

Chorus
<!-- The chorus emphasizes the idea of harmony and unity, comparing society to a piano where each key (person) matters. -->
Itâ€™s all written.
We're all keys on one piano.
If one's off, we all lose.
Let's do what's right, in the Song of Us.

Outro
What's our melody, whatâ€™s our story?
What part will you play,
In the grand finale, of the Song of Us

Does anybody care?
the Song of Us, the song of us
