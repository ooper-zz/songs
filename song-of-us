Verse 1
why is it, that winning means somebody has to lose?
Life's full of colors, not just one or two.
Don't you know We're all notes in a song, we choose.
As keys and chords in a piano, we all shine through
...In the Song of Us

Pre-Chorus
A wise man once said, "Love your neighbor"
But we're too busy, keeping score...

Chorus
Harmony, can't you see, it's more than a tune.
We're all keys on one piano.
If one's off, we all lose.
If we are all tuned, nobody has to lose.
Let it play, let it flow, in The Song of Us...
...he ONE Song of Us...

Pre-Chorus
He gave so much, asking for so little,
Can't we give back, solve this riddle?

Chorus
Harmony, can't you see, it's more than a tune.
We're all keys on one piano.
If one's off, we all lose.
If we are all tuned, nobody has to lose.
Let it play, let it flow, in The Song of Us...
...he ONE Song of Us...

Outro
The Song of Us, it starts in the heart
In this life's song, let love be your part
in The Song of Us? in The ONE Song of Us?

...What part will you play?
