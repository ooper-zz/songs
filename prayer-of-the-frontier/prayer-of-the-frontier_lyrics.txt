Verse 1
When we walk into the stars,
Let us carry more than steel—
Not just minds that reach too far,
But hearts that know to feel.

Chorus
Grant us wonder, grant us grace,
As we rise from time and dust.
May our power know its place—
In compassion, not just trust.

Verse 2
When our hands shape foreign lands,
Let them heal, not only build.
Let the silence not expand
Where the sacred once was filled.

Bridge
Guide the dreamer, stay the sword,
Teach the clever to be kind.
May the truths we can't afford
Still outshine the ones we find.

Final Chorus
Grant us wonder, grant us grace,
Not just victory, but soul.
In the stars, may we embrace
What still makes a person whole.
