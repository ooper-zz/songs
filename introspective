Verse 1:
An artist's box, a whirl of shades,
On one painting, they evade.
Like kids with crayons, in a color maze,
Too many colors, one canvas daze.

Chorus:
In the quiet corners of my room,
I find solace in the gloom.
Not antisocial, just introspective,
I find clarity in solitude.

Verse 2:
The world outside moves too fast,
But in my mind, time stands still.
Thoughts swirling, can't pin them down,
Too much inside, too much to bear.

Chorus:
In the quiet corners of my room,
I find solace in the gloom.
Not antisocial, just introspective,
I pray in faith in solitude

Bridge:
In the depths of my mind, I roam,
Exploring the landscapes of my dreams.
Not afraid silence, serenity it brings,
In solitude, my heart sings. 

Verse 3:
With her love as my guiding light,
I navigate the depths of night.
She's a beacon in the darkness,
Leading me through the vastness.

Chorus:
In the quiet corners of my room,
I find solace in the gloom.
Not antisocial, just introspective,
I find renewal in solitude.

Verse 4:
Her love, a flame that ignites,
Illuminating my creative heights.
Without her, I'd be lost at sea,
Drowning in uncertainty.

Chorus:
In the quiet corners of my room,
I find solace in the gloom.
Not antisocial, just introspective,
I find reflection in solitude.

Outro:
So if you find me lost in thought,
Know that in solitude, I'm sought.
Not antisocial, just instrospection,
In her support resides my peace of mind.
