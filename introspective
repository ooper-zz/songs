Verse 1:
In the quiet corners of my room,
I find solace in the gloom.
Not antisocial, just introspective,
In solitude.

Chorus:
Too much inside, too little out,
Love so close, yet so far.
Not seeking solace, just finding peace 
being on my own.

Verse 2:
The world outside moves too fast,
But in my mind, time can last.
Thoughts swirling, a silent tide,
Too much inside, too much to hide.

Chorus:
Too much inside, too little out,
Love so close, yet so far.
Not seeking to be on my own,
Just finding solace in the unknown.

Bridge:
In the depths of my mind, I roam,
Exploring the landscapes of my own.
Not afraid of the silence, the peace it brings,
In solitude

Chorus:
Too much inside, too little out,
Love so close, yet so far.
Not seeking to be on my own,
Just finding solace in the unknown.

Outro:
So if you find me lost in thought,
Know that in solitude, I'm wrought.
Not antisocial, just too much inside,
In ths quiet, my heart resides.
