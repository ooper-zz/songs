[Verse 1]

Special night, special day, the ocean awakes
Our souls surf over each of its waves
Bonfire crackles, it’s got something to say
The stars, all out for us, yet one shines bright

[Chorus]

On the sand, under the red star
Campfire glows, reflecting in your eyes
Our world behind, just you and me
A sudden kiss, and time defies
Under the red star, our love never dies

[Verse 2]

Years we've shared, in every wave
Memories cherished, none we’d trade
In the silence, my hand finds yours
Under the red star, our hearts align

[Chorus]

On the sand, under the red star
Campfire glows, reflecting in your eyes
Our world behind, just you and me
A sudden kiss, and time defies
Under the red star, our love never dies

[Bridge]

We've danced in an oasis, we’ve walked through fire
Through every high and every low
Under the red star, our love will glow

[Final Chorus]

On the sand, under the red star
Campfire glows, reflecting in your eyes
Our world behind, just you and me
A sudden kiss, and time defies
Under the red star, our love never dies

[Outro]

Under the red star, our love endures...
