[Verse 1]

Special night, the ocean's awake
Our souls surf on each wave
Bonfire crackles, an ensemble of light
but in our sky, one star shines bright

[Chorus]

On the sand, under the red star
Campfire glows, reflecting in your eyes
Our world behind, just you and me
A sudden kiss, and time defies
Under the red star, our love never dies

[Verse 2]

Years we've shared, in every wave
Memories cherished, none we’d trade
In the silence, my hand finds yours
Under the red star, our hearts align

[Chorus]

On the sand, under the red star
Campfire glows, reflecting in your eyes
Our world behind, just you and me
A sudden kiss, and time defies
Under the red star, our love never dies

[Bridge]

We've danced in an oasis, we’ve walked through fire
Through every high and every low
Under the red star, our love will glow

[Final Chorus]

On the sand, under the red star
Campfire glows, reflecting in your eyes
Our world behind, just you and me
A sudden kiss, and time defies
Under the red star, our love never dies

[Outro]

Under the red star, our love endures...
