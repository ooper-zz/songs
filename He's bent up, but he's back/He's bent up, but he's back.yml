[verse]
Hey Dad, Hey Dad, he said
He's right there, he's back,
Hey Dad, hey Dad, still lying there,
But he's back, no more fear.

[chorus]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, in his deepest dreams,
I'm sure he heard you, 
Now those dreams are true.
I know you were next to him, all along

He's bent up, but he's back!

[verse]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, through the haze,
He felt your touch, your gentle ways.
Hey Dad, hey Dad, through all the pain,
You were there, kept him safe.

[chorus]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, in his deepest dreams,
I'm sure he heard you,
Now those prayers came true.
I know you were next to me, all along
No worries, he's bent up, but he's back!

[bridge]
Through the silence, through the night,
You were his guiding light.
Now we have a chance to start,
To heal the wounds, mend the heart.

[verse]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, I heard you cry,
You tried to give him his first sip of water in while.
Hey Dad, hey Dad, you got yelled at for that,
but I'm sure he loves you for trying,
Hey Dad, hey Dad, he'll keep on fighting.

[chorus]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, in his deepest dreams,
I'm sure he heard you,
Now those prayers came true.
I know you were next to me, all along
No worries, he's bent up, but he's back!

[outro]
Hey Dad, hey Dad, hit begin,
A new chapter, where you both win.
Hey Dad, hey Dad, hand in hand,
Together, you will stand.
Hey Dad, hey Dad, it's your son,
Same old him, but he's back.
