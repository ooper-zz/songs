[Verse]
Man from Earth travels through,
Sees the sunrise anew.
But the heart is old and blue,
Lost in time he thinks of you.

[Chorus]
Is it heaven or just fate?
Can we find our way?
Life’s a mystery,
In our choices, we see.

[Verse 2]
John Teeter from the future,
He knows what will unfold.
Past and future take their toll,
Two hearts searching for their soul.

[Chorus]
Is it heaven or just fate?
Can we find our way?
Life’s a mystery,
In our choices, we see.

[Bridge]
Paths we walk, who can say?
Fate’s design leads astray.
Gift or curse, endless time,
Eternal drift, ageless climb.

[Chorus]
Is it heaven or just fate?
Can we find our way?
Life’s a mystery,
In our choices, we see.

[Verse 3]
Loved ones fade, mother's tear,
Life’s sharp edge, shadows near.
Years go by, yet I stand,
Watching worlds shift like sand.

[Chorus]
Is it heaven or just fate?
Can we find our way?
Life’s a mystery,
In our choices, we see.

[Verse 4]
Struggles bear, triumphs too,
What’s the truth, can we view?
Moments pass, doubts erased,
In the now, time embraced.

[Chorus]
Is it heaven or just fate?
Can we find our way?
Life’s a mystery,
In our choices, we see.

[Outro]
The answer’s hidden,
Let our faith decide.
For now, keep breathing
And make it count!
