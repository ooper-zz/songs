[Verse]
Man from Earth travels through
Sees the sunrise anew
But the heart is old and blue
Lost in time he thinks of you

[Verse 2]
John Teeter from the future
He knows what will unfold
Past and future take their toll
Two hearts searching for their soul

[Chorus]
Who could love forever
In a world that's never still
Timeless love will bend and shatter
But in dreams they love until

[Verse 3]
Through the centuries they meet
Timeâ€™s unkind repeating feat
Moments gone like dust in wind
Fighting what they can't defend

[Bridge]
Time will freeze them for a while
Hearts intertwined in every mile
Yet the clock keeps moving on
Leaving love when they're alone

[Chorus]
Who could love forever
In a world that's never still
Timeless love will bend and shatter
But in dreams they love until
