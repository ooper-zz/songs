[Intro]
[Piano and Strings Intro]

[Verse 1]
Each line etched deep, a tapestry of gold,
A gentle touch at dawn, a hand to hold,
A shared morning coffee, a smile from afar,
The notes that you leave, a guiding star.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every whisper, every shout,
Imprints of our hearts,
Through the shadows, through the doubt,
We've found where we belong.

[Chorus]
Body art of the heart, joys and smiles that shine,
Tattooed on our souls, woven through time,
Laughter and love, through calm and hail,
We rise, we shine, with love in our veins.

[Verse 2]
Opinions fade, like whispers in the wind,
Our love is true, in the light it will show,
Don't let doubts dim our glow,
Together we're strong, this we know.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every whisper, every shout,
Imprints of our hearts,
Through the shadows, through the doubt,
We've found where we belong.

[Chorus]
Body art of the heart, joys and smiles that shine,
Tattooed on our souls, woven through time,
Laughter and love, through calm and hail,
We rise, we shine, with love in our veins.

[Verse 3]
Serving as examples, showing paths to choose,
With love as our guide, there's nothing to lose,
In turbulence, we stand strong and bright,
Body art of the heart, leading through the night.

[Bridge]
Our place in this world, we craft with care,
Living in peace, if we dare,
Building a tapestry of memories shared,
With cherished ones, love declared.

[Outro]
Through trials and lessons, love to impart,
Marks etched deep in each heart.
Choosing heart over skin, with hope and art,
In this body art of the heart.
