[Lead in - solo interlude Transition]

We're not going back...

[very short pause]

[Verse 1]
They whisper of times when power ruled high,
When justice was silenced, buried and denied.
But we’ve seen the fight, the streets we bled,
And we won’t be bound by the lies they spread.

[Chorus Rap]
See no evil, hear no evil, say no evil they cried,
But the truth was buried, with nowhere to hide.
Now no more blinded eyes, we all can see,
The chains once hidden, now broken, we’re free.
No! We're not going back
Not going baaak, ah, ah, ak!

[Verse 2]
We’re not going back, chains forever rusted,
Not back to shadows, the light’s been trusted.
Dreams in sight, we’ll keep them alive,
United as one, only love will survive.

[Interlude]
(Brief musical break for emotional buildup)

[Bridge]
From ashes we rise, with fire in our chest,
The road is long, but we’ll never rest.

[Chorus Rap]
See no evil, hear no evil, say no evil they cried,
But the truth was buried, with nowhere to hide.
Now no more blinded eyes, we all can see,
The chains once hidden, now broken, we’re free.
No! We're not going back
Not going baaak, ah, ah, ak!

[Chorus]
We’re not going back, chains forever rusted,
Not back to shadows, the light’s been trusted.
Dreams in sight, we’ll keep them alive,
United as one, only love will survive.

[Outro]
The future is ours, left or right we ride,
The right’s not always right, the left leaves some behind.
But in truth, we’ll walk this line,
On that, we’ll always see it through.

[Repeat Chorus Rap]
See no evil, hear no evil, say no evil they cried,
But the truth was buried, with nowhere to hide.
Now no more blinded eyes, we all can see,
The chains once hidden, now broken, we’re free.
No! We're not going back
Not going baaak, ah, ah, ak!

[End]
