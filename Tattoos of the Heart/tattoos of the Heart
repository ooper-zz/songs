[Verse 1]
Each line etched deep, a story told,
A gentle touch, a hand to hold,
Morning coffee, a smile so bright,
The notes you leave, our guiding light.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every whisper, every shout,
Tattoos on our hearts,
Through the shadows, through the doubt,
We've found where we belong.

[Chorus]
Tattoos of the heart, smiles that shine,
Ink on our souls, through all time,
Laughter and love, through the hail,
We rise, we shine, love prevails.

[Post-Chorus]
We rise, we shine, love prevails,
Tattoos of the heart, tell our tale.

[Verse 2]
Opinions fade, like whispers thin,
Our love is true, it shows within,
Don't let doubts dim our light,
Together we're strong, day and night.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every whisper, every shout,
Tattoos on our hearts,
Through the shadows, through the doubt,
We've found where we belong.

[Chorus]
Tattoos of the heart, smiles that shine,
Ink on our souls, through all time,
Laughter and love, through the hail,
We rise, we shine, love prevails.

[Bridge]
Our place in this world, we craft with care,
Living in peace, if we dare,
Building memories, love declared,
With cherished ones, moments shared.

[Chorus]
Tattoos of the heart, smiles that shine,
Ink on our souls, through all time,
Laughter and love, through the hail,
We rise, we shine, love prevails.

[Outro]
Through trials and lessons, love to impart,
Marks etched deep in each heart,
Choosing heart over skin, with hope and art,
In these tattoos of the heart.
