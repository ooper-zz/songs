[verse 1: I - vi - IV - V]
I
I know you love me and I love you too
vi
But this merry-go-round is making us blue
IV
The words of hurt are ripples of yours
V
and sometime yours are ripples of mine

I
I feel like an ant, antennas curled up
vi
I no longer know where I’m going
IV
maybe on a one-way ticket to nowhere land
V
or try to implore you in this song

[chorus: I - V - vi - IV]
I
I thought we were falling in love again
V
Hoping to find the way of us two
vi
but Promises made, promises broken
IV
And still, oly few changes 
vi
and yet more chains...

I
Don’t we know where we came from?
V
How do we know where we’re going?
vi
Ohhhh, we’re just drifting
A 
in this endless loop of chains

I                     V
Faith and change, we need to find
vi                    IV
Faith and change, to break the bind
I                     V
Faith and change, to see us through
vi                    IV
Faith and change, for me and you

[verse 2]
I
What will it take to break the chain,
vi
Of going back to the past and then again?
IV
Yet here we are, unable to solve the riddle
V
More by prayer than by faith, stuck in the middle
I
Ohhhh
vi
Ohhhh

[bridge: I - V - vi - IV]
I
Finding a path, keeping the faith
V
Praying and hoping, each and every day
vi
But I gotta see the promised land
IV
To endure it all, to make me stay

I
Keeping the faith, praying strong
V
Trying so hard, it's been so long
vi
Gotta see the changes, see them through
IV
To endure this love, and stay with you

[outro: I - V - vi - IV]
I
Finding a path, keeping the faith
V
Praying and hoping, each and every day
vi
But I gotta see the promised land
IV
To endure it all, to make me stay

I
Keeping the faith, praying strong
V
Trying so hard, it's been so long
vi
Gotta see the changes, see them through
IV
To endure this love, and stay with you
