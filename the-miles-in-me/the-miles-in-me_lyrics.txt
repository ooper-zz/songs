Verse 1:
I thought if I kept climbing,
pedaling on,
I’d find the prize at the top.
Pace tight—
I could almost taste it.
Then watched the wheels spin back.

Chorus:
You know,
I used to think I had to keep climbing
chasing something out there.
But the mountain never gets closer.
And maybe that’s the point.
I’ve seen more life,
more of the miles in me,
since I stopped marching forward.

Verse 2:
Then I drifted off the trail—
no map, just love,
learn, breath, and sky.
There, I found more
in a single shared smile
than all I thought I’d find
up the hill.

Bridge:
And maybe—
I should’ve bloomed,
not burned.
Singing,
not sinking.

Outro:
And now,
when I look back-
I see I moved
more than I knew.
Not by reaching,
but by being.
The smiles I gathered,
the miles in me—
the seeds I sow,
more lasting
than an accolade without scars
