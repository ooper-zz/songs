Verse 1
From Galilee to Assisi’s hills to Ligurian sea, 
to the New World it sailed—
The fog rolls in low—did the ocean exhale?
It moves like a robe in the slow-falling dark.
No sound, no warning…
Is it mist... or something divine?

Chorus
The mist remembers
Moves with grace where soft winds blow.
It kneels on hills, in silence waits
It carries footsteps slow and kind,
A robe of peace and compassion that trails behind
The hummingbird knows, its flutter still—
While crows cry loud, unknowing still.

The mist remembers—
And the hummingbird knows!

Bridge
The hummingbird hovers, quiet and true,
The crow calls out, cutting through.
Each reads the wind their own way—
Still, the mist does not betray.
It finds its form without a claim,
And settles softly in my spirit.

Chorus (repeat)
The mist remembers
Moves with grace where soft winds blow.
It kneels on hills, in silence waits
It carries footsteps slow and kind,
A robe of peace and compassion that trails behind
The hummingbird knows, its flutter still—
While crows cry loud, unknowing still.

The mist remembers—
And the hummingbird knows!

Outro
And I dance with the melody of the fog,
As it curls and climbs across the sky.
More arrives, soft as breath,
And I open—
Letting it in.
