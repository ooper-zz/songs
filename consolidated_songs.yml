- title: Memorabilia
  lyrics: |-
    In quiet halls of time I roam
    Your smile, a beacon leading home
    Only to wake, my visit's gone
    paid with the currency of time

    If I could walk the streams of time
    Where every second flows in line
    a ripple through the fabric of time
    Memorabilia, if only once again
    hold your hand in mine...oh-oh-oh!

    Memorabilia!!!!

    Through laughter shared and lessons learned
    Quality time, a candle’s light
    nostalgically held so dear
    destined to pass on, forever more

    If I could walk the streams of time
    Where every second flows in line
    a ripple through the fabric of time
    Memorabilia, if only once again
    hold your hand in mine

    Memorabilia!!!!

    I count each blessing gained
    in every turn, a lesson claimed
    Through dreams, never small
    I find the strength to face it all

    Thank you for your life, so strong and brave
    I hope my love, through time, will stay
    a part of you
    forever, in some small way
    forever, in some small way...

    [Chorus]
    (Spanglish, por todos lados)
    Spanglish! Coast to coast
    Miami nights, con sabor Caribeño
    D.C. streets, shoutin' “¡Vamos, mi gente!” (viva el istmo Centro americano!)
    TexMex heat, LA dreams, all one familia

    (Spanglish, por todos lados)
    Spanglish! From East to West
    Flags up high, bright and proud
    Spanglish love, in every town

    [Verse 1]
    We’re here together, Americano strong
    From barrio streets to city songs
    In Miami nights, con ritmo y fé
    D.C. pride, "We’re here to stay"

    Like salsa that spices up the goods,
    In every corner, every neighborhood
    One voice, one beat, we’re here as one
    Latino roots, Americano sun

    [Pre-Chorus]
    The 52nd star in red, white, and blue
    Latino pride, Americano too

    [Chorus]
    (Spanglish, por todos lados)
    Spanglish! Coast to coast
    Miami nights, con sabor Caribeño

    (Spanglish, por todos lados)
    Spanglish! From East to West
    Flags up high, bright and proud
    Spanglish love, in every town

    [Verse 2]
    From coast to coast, our flags collide
    TexMex streets to Cali vibes
    With every dance, cada canción,
    We bring the heart, we bring el son

    In Brooklyn nights and Chi-Town beats,
    We’re roots and dreams on every street
    A blend of worlds, proud and free,
    Americano soul, Latino dream

    [Bridge]
    Somos familia, de aquí y allá
    One rhythm rising, no importa el lugar
    The stars shine bright, we all belong
    Spanglish pride, our colors strong

    [Chorus]
    (Spanglish, por todos lados)
    Spanglish! Coast to coast
    Miami nights, con sabor Caribeño

    [Solo Grand Piano Intro]

    Verse 1
    I look at you as if we’ve just met,
    Our warm embrace never to forget.
    A ray of light in a sky of gray,
    in our embrace, we found our way.

    Chorus
    Today is golden, love still shines,
    Through every turn, your hand with mine.
    Whatever may come, whatever's been,

    I see you now as I saw you then!

    Verse 2
    Smiles unfold like morning light,
    Soft and steady, pure and bright.
    No need for words, no need to chase,
    Every moment still falls into place.

    Today is golden, love still shines,
    Through every turn, your hand with mine.

    Not lost in the past, not fearing the new,
    Just living the promise I made with you.

    Cielos estrellados, susurros silenciosos

    Each line etched deep, a story told,
    A gentle touch, a hand to hold,
    Morning coffee, a smile so bright,
    The notes you leave, our guiding light.

    [Pre-Chorus]

  lyrics: |-
    [Verse 1 – A Whispered Beginning]
    Desde tu vientre, escuché mi nombre,
    flotando en aguas de un mundo sin sol.
    Tu risa danzaba al oleaje,
    una hebra de luz en mi corazón.

    [Pre-Chorus – The Wonder of Creation]
    Antes del alba, fui solo un suspiro,
    polvo en el viento, sombra en la mar.
    Pero tu voz me tejió entre nudos,
    y en tu latido, aprendí a escuchar.

    [Chorus – Sweeping Melody]
    Y cuando abrí los ojos, tu risa fue sonrisa,
    el tejido tomó forma y de tu voz oí mi nombre.
    Tu voz dijo mi nombre—
    desde tu vientre, supe que nunca me perderé.

    Desde tu vientre!

    [Verse 2 – The Questions of the Unborn Soul]
    ¿Seré un lucero en una noche callada,
    o vendrán más soles después de mí?
    ¿Seré el unicornio que cruza tu prado,
    o una manada corriendo hacia ti?

    [Chorus – Stronger Emotion]
    Y cuando abrí los ojos, tu risa fue sonrisa,
    el tejido tomó forma y de tu voz oí mi nombre—
    desde tu vientre, supe que nunca me perderé.

    Desde tu vientre!

    [Bridge – The Journey to Birth]
    El agua cedió, la luz me alcanzó,
    un trueno estalló en mi piel dormida.
    Sombras y fuego rasgaron mi mundo,
    y yo solo buscaba tu voz.

    [Outro – Divine Whisper]
    Antes del tiempo, antes del miedo,
    fui solo un eco en la inmensidad…
    que con un vagido, Dios me hizo real.

    Verse 1:(vi) Driving home late into the night,(IV) From another long day by her side.(I) The dialysis machine hums its tune,(V) A reminder of battles, far from immune.(vi) The road stretches out, dark and long,(IV) Each mile, a verse in her survival song.

    (vi) Wrong side of the freeway, a jolt, a scare,(IV) A moment’s lapse, gasping for air.(I) The flickering light now a fluttering candle in the wavering breeze,(V) A gentle gust through my window wakes me; I straighten up, at ease.

    Chorus:(I) Like flickering candle, in the dead of night,(V) Her spirit wavers but holds on tight.(vi) As I fight the drowsiness, trying to stay awake,(IV)  a gentle breeze keeps me awake,through her own will to live.

    Verse 2:(vi) Thoughts deep as the night is dark,(IV) Her life’s journey, marked by a question mark.(I) Reconciliation with her kin, a wish unspoken,(V) Amid the rollercoaster of lives, once broken. (vi) The freeway’s emptiness mirrors my fear,(IV) A life without her, unimaginably austeers.

    Bridge:(ii) A car abandoned, with a door ajar,(vi) One headlight fading, like a dimming candle.(iii) No soul inside, yet it speaks to me,(V) Of my own off-road escape, a plea.

    Verse 3:(vi) Wrong side of the freeway, a jolt, a scare,(IV) A moment’s lapse, gasping for air.(I) A flickering light, dimming slow,(V) A wake-up call, life’s fragile show.

    Chorus:(I) Like a flickering light in the dead of night,(V) Her spirit wavers but holds on tight.(vi) In the face of death, a plea, a fight,(IV) A moment’s fear, a wake-up sight.

    Outro:(vi) As dawn breaks, a new resolve is born,(IV) To reconcile, to heal, before we’re torn.(I) Her flickering light, a beacon in the dark,(V) Guiding us home, igniting a spark.

    On the journey to myself, didn’t mean to hide,
    Through the highs and the lows, only my bike to ride.
    The wheels of my Harley just kept turning,
    handlebars stopped steering.

    #Bridge
    A voice once hailed, now stale,
    Through it all, It was heads or tail.
    Time rolls on, the music fades,
    Somewhere out there, I lost my way.

    #Outro
    The road ahead is still unknown,
    But love remains, it’s what I’ve sown.
    Through every breath, the voice will stay,
    A light of hope to guide my way.

    Caught in the silence, words on the edge,

    Before the storm can make the rain,
    Pause your world—rewrite the moment.

    Erase the echoes, let the healing begin.
    Before regret can stake its claim,

    In the dawn of thought, where shadows play,
    A Spitha shines and lights the way,
    New ideas bloom in open minds,
    Whispers of wonder, undefined.

    [Pre-Chorus]
    From a spark, a flame, a burning fire,
    Dreams take flight, lift us higher!
    Peace and rage in a dance so grand,
    On the stage of life, hand in hand.
    Spitha, a new Idea, write it down!

    Guiding us through, making all things new,
    Oh-oh, in the heart of living, a sacred key,
    Oh-oh, unlocking paths to what we can't see.
    Spitha, the Idea, our sacred key!

    From old times, a purpose shines,
    Every soul with dreams aligns,
    In Plato’s world, we seek the light,
    Chasing shadows through the night.

    [Verse 3]
    Love, music, art, tech, and oh, war,
    Ideas that shape us, near and far,
    Science, faith, dreams that soar,
    From the past to who we are.
    Spitha, an idea, write it down!

    [Chorus]
    Spitha, the spark in us, a gift so true,
    Guiding us through, making all things new,
    Oh-oh, in the heart of living, a sacred key,
    Oh-oh, unlocking paths to what we can't see.
    Spitha, the Idea, our sacred key!

    [Bridge]
    A gift from above, we understand,
    Guiding our hearts, holding our hand,
    Reason and faith, they guide our way,
    In every night, there is a day.

    When we come together, our dreams take flight,
    From the pyramids to the moon’s bright light,

    Always more than alright, narrowing the distance, our guiding light.

    From a whisper to a thunder sound,
    Ideas lift us, never let us down,
    Oh-oh, in the thread of life, forever spread,
    Spitha, the spark in us, always ahead.
    Spitha, a gift for you and me!
    Built by and for you and me, Together!
