[Verse 1]
We search for meaning, far and wide,
Like lost love slipping through our minds.
Retrace the steps, go back in time,
The truth was there, right in our eyes...

[Chorus]
We miss the signs, they're hard to see,
But how about how to fix love...
K-I-S-S, keep it super simple!
One gentle touch, the heart revealed,
Untangling feelings we thought were sealed.

[Verse 2]
We twist our hearts, the knots grow tight,
But one soft word can make it right.
A simple truth, no need to shout,
Love flows in when we let it out.

[Chorus]
We miss the signs, they're hard to see,
But how about how to fix love...
K-I-S-S, keep it super simple!
One gentle touch, the heart revealed,
Untangling feelings we thought were sealed.

[Interlude]
(Instrumental, softening the mood before the bridge)

[Bridge]
It’s in the quiet, in the pause,
Where love just is, without a cause.
A single touch can mend it all,
The answer’s simpler than we thought.

[Chorus]
We miss the signs, they're hard to see,
But how about how to fix love...
K-I-S-S, keep it super simple!
One gentle touch, the heart revealed,
Untangling feelings we thought were sealed.

[outro]
K-I-S-S, keep it simple, silly...

[fade out]
