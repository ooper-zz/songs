[begin]
[Verse 1]
You sang of nightmares, and they crowned you a prophet
But the mirror kept flashing fanfare and profit
You walked out the door, left the Folk folks behind
A restless soul, seeking an unsung song to sing!

[short breath]
[Chorus – And So I Answer]
Maybe the answer was never one.
If love is the reason, if mercy still calls,
Then maybe the answer is never a wall...

Maybe the song has already sung.
Maybe a carpenter carved it in the wind!

[Verse 2 – When is a man truly a man? (The Journey’s the Destination)]
You sang of the roads, the miles left behind,
But a man ain't a man by the steps he can climb.
Not dust on his boots, not the battles he wins,
But the love that he sows, the hearts he lets in.

[breath]
[Verse 3 – How long before we listen? (Hear the Silence from Within) and Lend me an Ear]
You asked how many ears must a man have to hear,
But the deafest are those who never lent an ear.
The cries on the wind, they still pitch today,
But love breaks the silence and clears out the gray.

[short breath]
[Chorus]
Maybe the answer was never one.
If love is the reason, if mercy still calls,
Then maybe the answer is never a wall...

Maybe the song has already sung.
Maybe a carpenter carved it in the wind!

The answer's carved in the Wind...

[end fade out]
