        why is it, that win -- ning means some -- bo -- dy has to lose
        when life is full of col -- ors, not just one or two?
        Don't you know, we're all notes in a song we choose,
        and as keys and chords in a pi -- a -- no, we all shine through?
        A wise man said, "Love your neigh -- bor,"
        yet we're too busy keep -- ing fa -- vor...
        Har -- mo -- ny, it's more than just a tune.
        We're all just keys lay -- ing on a pi -- a -- no,
        so let's play in tune, let it flow!
        Don't you see, Har -- mo -- ny's the song of us...
        He gave so much, ask -- ing for so lit -- tle,
        why can't we give back and solve the rid -- dle?
        Har -- mo -- ny, it's more than just a tune.
        We're all just keys lay -- ing on a pi -- a -- no,
        so let's play in tune, let it flow!
        Don't you see, Har -- mo -- ny's the song of us...
        The Song of Us, it starts in the heart
        In this life's song, let love be our part
        in The Song of Us? in The ONE Song of Us?
