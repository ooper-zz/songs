[Verse]
Never knew your face
Just a faded portrait
An image of a memory
That’s all that’s left

[Chorus]
Only a picture to remember
Lost moments, a silent ember
A broken bond
but in my dreams you’ve never gone!

[Verse 2]
I often wonder who you’d be
A guiding light, a friend to me
Your absence is a plea
For the life we lost

[Chorus]
Only a picture to remember
Lost moments, a silent ember
A broken bond
In my dreams you’ve never gone

[Bridge]
We lived out of time
The fragile thread of life
This could have been me!
Hence, for the remainder of my life
I have to make it count!

[Outro]
Your memory will guide me through,
When it's my time, I'll know your smiling face 
wait for me at the gate
and and embrase me in flight

Only a picture to remember...
Only a picture to remember!
