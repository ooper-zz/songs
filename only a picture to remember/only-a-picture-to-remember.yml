[Verse]
Never knew your face
Just a faded portrait
An image of a memory
That’s all that’s left

[Verse 2]
I often wonder who you’d be
A guiding light
A friend to me
Your absence is a plea
For the life we lost what could have been

[Chorus]
Only a picture to remember
Lost moments a silent ember
A broken bond
In my dreams you’ve never gone

[Verse 3]
When my time comes I hope to see
Your smiling face
Don’t be too busy in heaven’s light
Wait for me at the gates embrace me in flight

[Bridge]
This could have been me
We were apart for a time
The fragile thread of life
Can break the heart
For now I want to make it count
I got to make it count
For now for the life we lost
Em now worlds apart

[Chorus]
Only a picture to remember
Lost moments a silent ember
A broken bond
In my dreams you’ve never gone
