Verse 1:
I never knew your face
just a faded portrait
An image of a memory
that’s all that’s left

Verse 2:
I often wonder who you’d be
A guiding light, a friend to me.
Your absence is a plea
For the life we lost, what could have been.

Chorus:
Only a picture to remember
Lost moments, a silent ember.
A broken bond
In my dreams you’ve never gone.

Chorus:
Only a picture to remember,
Lost moments, a silent ember.
A broken bond,
In my dreams, you’ve never gone.

Verse 3:
When my time comes
I hope to see your smiling face.
Don’t be too busy in heaven’s light
Wait for me at the gates, embrace me in flight.

Bridge:
This could have been me
we were apart for a time
The fragile thread of life can break the heart.
For now, I want to make it count
I got to make it count
For now, for the life we lost
Em now worlds apart.

Chorus:
Only a picture
to remember
Lost moments
a silent ember.
A broken bond
In my dreams you’ve never
gone.

Outro:
In heaven’s embrace,
we’ll reunite,
Two souls
in flight.
Until then,
I keep your memory close,
Waiting for the day,
without fear.


Temp:
In my heart, there’s an empty space
I dreamed you’d stay
