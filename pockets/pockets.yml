#VERSE
Standing in line at a caf√©
Placing an order, I dig for change
Loose coins jingle, crumpled bills
More than I can handle

#HOOK
Yet, pockets scream for more!!

#CHORUS
Pockets full, what to keep?
A picture of you, a note, or something deep?
Hands come up empty, but the weight remains
What's worth holding when life's so strained?

#VERSE
I had enough for a snack for you
In cluttered pockets, I thought of you
A moment of silence made it all true
Coin jingles calling out for you!

#CHORUS
Pockets full, what to keep?
A picture, a note, or something deep?
Hands come up empty, but the weight remains
What's worth holding when life's so strained?

#BRIDGE
When hands are empty, what will stay?
The weight we carried, or the love we shared?

#HOOK
The weight we carried, or the love we shared
