[Verse 1]
Standing in line at a café,
Placing an order, I dig for change.
Loose coins jingle, crumpled bills...
More than I can handle,

Yet, pockets scream for more!!

[breath]
[Chorus]
Pockets full, what to keep?
A picture of you, a note, or something deep?
Hands come up empty, but the weight remains
What’s worth holding when life’s so strained?

[breath]
[Verse 2]
I had enough for a snack for you,
In cluttered pockets, I thought of you
a moment of silence made it all true
coin jingles calling out for you!

[breath]

[Chorus]
Pockets full, what do I keep?
A picture, a note, or something deep?
Hands come up empty, but the weight remains
What’s worth holding when life’s so strained?

[short interlude]

[Bridge]
When hands are empty, what will stay?
The weight we carried, or the love we shared?

[breath]
[Chorus]:
Pockets full, what to keep?
A picture, a note, or something deep?
Hands come up empty, but the weight remains
What’s worth holding when life’s so strained?

[interlude]
[Bridge]
When hands are empty, what will stay?
The weight we carried, or the love we shared?

The weight we carried, or the love we shared...
[fade out]
[end]
