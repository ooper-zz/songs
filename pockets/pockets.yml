Verse 1:

Standing in line at the café,
Placing an order, I dig for change
Loose coins jingle, a crumpled bills...
More than I can handle
Yet pockets scream for more! Oh-oh-oh

Chorus:

Pockets full, what to keep?
A picture, a note, perhaps something deep?
Hands come up empty, but the weight remains
What’s worth holding when life’s so strained?

Verse 2:

I had enough for a snack
a thought that made it alright
In crowded pockets, you brought light...

Chorus:

The thought of you made the search feel true
Loose coins spent, but it felt right
In crowded pockets, you brought light

When hands are empty, what will stay?
The weight we carried, or the love we shared?
