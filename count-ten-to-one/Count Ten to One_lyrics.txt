[intro Grand Piano]

[Chorus]
Fire in your chest, trying to break free,
Mind keeps pushing, who should you be?
Hold your breath, bite your tongue, stay still,
Storm is raging, but you’ve got the will...

Count Ten to One!

[Verse 1] (Counting Down: 10 to 6 – Chaos & Struggle)
Ten voices screaming, thunder cracks the sky,
Nine fears rising, won’t let them decide.
Eight steps backward, caught in the tide,
Seven shadows yelling, "Run and hide."
Six clenched fists, but you hold the line.

[short breath]

[Chorus]
Fire in your chest, trying to break free,
Mind keeps pushing, who should you be?
Hold your breath, bite your tongue, stay still,
Storm is raging, but you’ve got the will.

Count Ten to One!

[Verse 2] (Counting Down: 5 to 2 – Gaining Control)
Five deep breaths, slow the flames inside,
Four doubts linger, but you turn the tide.
Three steps forward, breaking through,
Two feet steady—nothing moves you.

[Bridge] (Final Stand – One Last Moment)
Mind says, "Easy escapes don’t make you strong,"
Fire burns, but you keep holding on.
Through the flames, you carve your way,
One last step, you rise today.

[Chorus]
Fire in your chest, trying to break free,
Mind keeps pushing, who should you be?
Hold your breath, bite your tongue, stay still,
Storm is raging, but you’ve got the will.

Count Ten to One!

[Outro] (Final Countdown: 1 – Resolution & Power)
One last breath… you rise, you're free.

[end fade out]
