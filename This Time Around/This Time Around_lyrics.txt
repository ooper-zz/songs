[begin]
[Intro Grand Piano Soft, emotional Grand Piano arpeggios]

[Chorus]
No more doubt, no more fear
Through every storm, we’re staying near
This time around, love’s crystal clear
We’ll keep the lights on, through every tear

[Hook / Refrain]
This time around, we rise, we rise, we rise!

[Bridge]
We’ve been broken, we’ve been scarred,
But every scar a brand-new start.
We’ll renew our vows in present tense,
This time around, we’ll make it last.

[Chorus]
No more doubt, no more fear
Through every storm, we’re staying near
This time around, love’s crystal clear
We’ll keep the lights on, through every tear

[Outro / Hook]
This time around, we light the way
This time around, we light the way

[final vocal echo]
This Time around...

[end]
