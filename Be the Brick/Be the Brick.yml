[Intro]

[Short Breath]

[Verse 1]
Set in place, strong and steady,
Layer by layer, built to carry,
Through timeless summers and winters,
the will, standing firm, unbroken.

[Short Breath]

[Chorus]
Be the brick, hold up the weight,
Built to stand, no fear of fate,
More than clay in designer’s hand,
A strength that rises, it transcends.
Don't despair, when life’s too thick,

Be the brick—that’s the trick!

[Short Breath]

[Verse 2]
Bound by purpose, laid with care,
A part of something strong and rare,
In designer’s hand, the vision grows,
Each piece a story, no one knows.

[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Look closely, each brick stands apart,
Colors, shapes—a work of art,
Aligned in purpose, side by side,
Uniquely designed, none can hide.

[Final Chorus]
Be the brick, hold up the weight,
Built to stand, no fear of fate,
More than clay in designer’s hand,
A strength that rises, it transcends.
So do not despair, when life’s too thick,
Be the brick—and that’s the trick.

[bridge]
Like Kahn’s vision, humble yet grand,
Gaudí’s dream, sculpted by hand,
Wright’s world woven into stone,
Be for more—be the brick.

[Outro]
A designer's in the mirror...you're not just another brick in the wall (repeat softly, then fade)
