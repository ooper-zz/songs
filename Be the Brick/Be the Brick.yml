[Intro grand piano]
[Intro]

[Short Breath]

[Verse 1]
Set in place, strong and steady,
Layer by layer, built to carry,
Through summer's heat and winter’s chill,
Standing firm, unbroken will.

[Short Breath]

[Chorus]
Be the brick, hold up the weight,
Built to stand, no fear of fate,
More than clay, designer’s hand,
A strength that rises, it transcends.
So do not despair, when life’s too thick,

Be the brick!

[Short Breath]

[Verse 2]
Bound by purpose, laid with care,
A part of something strong and rare,
In the designer’s hand, the vision grows,
Each piece a story no one knows.

[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Look closely, each brick stands apart,
Colors, shapes—a work of art,
Aligned in purpose, side by side,
Uniquely designed, none can hide.

A simple brick, 
aspiring to be something more...

[Final Chorus]
Be the brick, hold up the weight,
Built to stand, no fear of fate,
More than clay in designer’s hand,
A strength that rises, it transcends.
So do not despair, when life’s too thick...

Be the brick! 

[Outro]
Be the brick… (repeat softly, then fade)
