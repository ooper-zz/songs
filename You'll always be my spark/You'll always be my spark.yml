[Verse]
Smart head, tonic heart
From the start you were my spark
In mum's womb your name, my voice
Daddy's girl my heart is yours

[Verse 2]
In stepping out, will you do right?
Living strong your own bright light
Without me now you're on your way
In your world you'll seize the day

[Chorus]
You will always be my spark
Through every light, and every stop
Memories of ours, will always flow
Building dreams you'll always grow

[Verse 3]
From small dreams to the large
Now in your world you're in charge
But remember no matter far
You'll always be my shining star

[Chorus]
You will always be my spark
Through every light through every dark
Memories like rivers flow
Building dreams you'll always grow

[Bridge]
Daddy's girl now take your flight
Under moon and under stars so bright
In your strength you'll find your might
But in my heart you'll be the light
