[Verse 1]
Hey son, in the quiet, I stayed,
Held your hand, softly prayed.
Waited for a sign, a scratch, a blink,
Why won’t you wake?

[Chorus]
In your stillness, my heart knew,
God would guide us, bring us through.
Then I heard, "hey dad,"
All bent up but you're back,
Hey son, hey son.

[Verse 2]
Hey son, brought the water,
Held the cup,
Wet your lips,
Prayed you'd sip.

[Chorus]
In your stillness, my heart knew,
God would guide us, bring us through.
Then I heard, "hey dad,"
All bent up but you're back,
Hey son, hey son.

[Bridge]
Through the silence,
Through the night,
Found our strength,
Reached the light.

[Outro]
Hey son, let’s start anew,
Hand in hand, just us two.
Step by step, father and son,
Together, our journey’s begun.
