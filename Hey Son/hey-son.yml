[Verse]
Hey son in the quiet I stayed
Held your hand softly prayed
Waited for a sign a scratch a blink
Why won’t you wake? Oh!

[Chorus]
In your stillness my heart knew
God would guide us bring us through
Then I heard hey dad!
You're all bent up but you're back! oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Hey son brought you water
Held the cup wet your lips
Prayed you'd take the sip

[Chorus]
In your stillness my heart knew
God would guide us bring us through
Then I heard hey dad!
You're all bent up but you're back! oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Through the silence
Through the night
Found our strength
Reached the light

[Outro]
Hey son let’s start anew
Hand in hand just us two
Step by step father and son
Together our journey’s begun
Hey son hey son..
