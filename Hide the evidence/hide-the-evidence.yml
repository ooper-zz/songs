[Verse 1 male]
Yellow blooms in June,
A bouquet for my little girl.
And one to go for Mom too...
“We’re not supposed to cut those, Dad” she giggled.
I claimed, “It's fine, they're just wildflowers”.

[Verse 2]
Back at the cabin,
Her Godfather came by with hot chocolate,
“Did you cut those poppies?”  
“It’s illegal, you know.” He dared. (well, did you, did you?) 
OhOh

[Chorus]
Hide the evidence, into the fire!
Laughter fills the room, hearts inspired.
Daughter's giggle, father's grin,
Precious moments live on, deep within.
¡Ay, ay, ay! Hide the evidence!

[Rap Bridge]
In simple moments, we find our way,
Laughing together, at the end of the day.
So much to learn, both ways,
Her little hand in mine, our love will blaze.
Cutting poppies in the field, a rebel move,
Illegal flowers, but we got nothing to prove.
Memories we make, they forever stay,
In our hearts and minds, they’ll never fade away.

[Chorus]
Hide the evidence, into the fire!
Laughter fills the room, hearts inspired.
Daughter's giggle, father's grin,
Precious moments live on, deep within.
¡Ay, ay, ay! Hide the evidence!

[Outro]
California poppies, state law!
As for dad, next stop: maybe Hotel California,
Where he may never leave! (never leave)
¡Ha, ha, ha!
Hide the evidence...
