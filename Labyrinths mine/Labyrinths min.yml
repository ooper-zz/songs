[Chorus]
Shadows in daylight, labyrinths mine,
Lonely heart, no oneâ€™s sign,
Hollow echoes in the mind,
Searching for solace, none to find.

[Verse 1]
Walls built, now closing in,
Hiding, the world churns,
Heartfelt, silent cries,
But all lost, in labyrinths mine.

[Verse 2]
Filling voids, heart on trial,
One battles shadows too vile,
Awaiting, missing in action,
Labyrinths, their new home.

[Bridge]
Labyrinths mine, shadows fade,
Finding light, a path is made.
Through the trials, strength will grow,
From the depths, a brighter glow.
