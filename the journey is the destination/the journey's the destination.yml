[VERSE]
When I hit the road
I cast my dreams, a place to roam.
Yet I do not know where I'm going...
But I'm ready, my feet are glowing!

[PRE-CHORUS]
(instrumental)

[CHORUS]
The voyage is the destination,
where you find inspiration.
Taking the highs with the lows,
Hit "Record", and out you go!

[PRE-VERSE]
la-la-la-la

ta-ta-ta-ta
ta-ta-ta-ta

[VERSE 2]
Be a local,  
speak their language (at least try?),
do right at every turn.
share stories, laugh and cry (Be alive!).

[PRE-CHORUS]
Do what's right. Keep breathing. 
Keep moving...(oh-oh)
(instrumental)

CHORUS]
The voyage is the destination,
where you find inspiration.
Taking the highs with the lows,
Hit "Record", and out you go!

[Verse 3]
All that is worth getting,
won't come easy, no forgetting.
Some will come, and some will go,
but follow The Way

[Bridge]
Give it your best, do what's right
pray or talk, what is the difference?
pack up light, follow through.
Seek your purpose, seek your peace

[Outro]
Through every storm,
Learn your lessons.
Enjoy the ride, --or start anew.
but on this voyage, 

you just got to keep breathing!
