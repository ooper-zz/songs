[Verse 1]
A special night
Moonlight's bright
Campfire glows
Your eyes, reflecting
The scene so bright

[Verse 2]
A veil of stars
Slowly drifting feather
Jewels align
In perfect harmony
A radiant bond
Unites us as one

[Pre-Chorus]
A stolen kiss
Soft as the night
Under red glow
Our hearts take flight
Whispers of love
Echo the night
With every heartbeat
Everything’s right

[Chorus]
Tonight
Waves hum our song
A place, where we can dance
In perfect harmony
Under the red star
Our love takes flight (ooh yeah)

Under that red star
Our love takes flight!! uh-uh-t

[Bridge]
Stars above, bearing witness to our vow
Under the red star, our love’s just begun
[Outro]
In the warmth of the sand, we slip and we glide
Bodies entwined, with Mars as our guide
Rolling as one, in the night’s fiery embrace
Under the red star, passion leaves no trace
