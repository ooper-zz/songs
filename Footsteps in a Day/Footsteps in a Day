[Intro: soft grand piano]
[Verse 1: sad, reflective]
Morning light, slips through the blinds,
Clock ticks, same old grind.
Really wake up,
Let every new footstep, lead a new way,
like age old wandering cattle,new roads are paved...

[Chorus: hopeful, uplifting]
Footsteps in a day, uncharted ground,
Time’s a wheel, forever it spins.
Break the cycle, let new life begin.
From dawn to dusk, we hold the key,
To trace new paths, and be free...
Be free! 

[Verse 2: reflective, contemplative]
Afternoon fades, shadows grow,
Clock keeps turning, but we take it slow.
Every step, fresh pastures anew,
Building the roads, we break through.(break through)

[Bridge: hopeful, determined]

One day, we’ll wake, we break 
Finding fresh fields, make each step last.
Build new highways, a different way,
Beyond the footsteps in a day.

[Chorus - Repeat: hopeful, uplifting]

Footsteps in a day, on unchatered ground,
Time’s a circle, let’s turn it around.
From dawn to dusk, we hold the key,
tracing new paths, we are free.

[end]
