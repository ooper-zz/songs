[Verse 1: sad, reflective]
Morning light slips through the blinds,
Clock ticking, same old grind.
Each new footstep leads the way,
like age old wandering cattle,
new roads we pave.

[Chorus: hopeful, uplifting]
Footsteps in a day, uncharted ground,
Time’s a circle, let’s turn it around.
From dawn to dusk, we hold the key,
To trace new paths, and to be free.

[Verse 2: reflective, contemplative]
Afternoon fades, shadows grow,
Clock keeps turning, but we take it slow.
Every step seeks fresh pastures new,
Building the roads as we break through.

[Bridge: hopeful, determined]

One day, we’ll wake, break from the past,
Find fresh fields, make each step last.
Build new highways, a different way,
Beyond the footsteps in a day.

[Chorus - Repeat: hopeful, uplifting]

Footsteps in a day, on untrodden ground,
Time’s a circle, let’s turn it around.
From dawn to dusk, we hold the key,
To trace new paths, and to be free.
