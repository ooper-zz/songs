[Intro: soft grand piano]
[Verse 1: sad, reflective]
Morning light, slips through blinds,
Clock ticks, same old grind.
Let every footstep, lead the way,
like wandering cattle, new roads be paved...

[Chorus: hopeful, uplifting]
Footsteps in a day, uncharted ground,
Time’s a wheel, forever spins.
Break the cycle, let new life begin.
From dawn to dusk, we hold the key,
To trace new paths, and be free. Be free!

[Verse 2: reflective, contemplative]
Afternoon fades, shadows grow,
Clock keeps turning, but take it slow.
Every step, fresh pastures,
Building roads, we break through. (we break through...)

[Bridge: hopeful, determined]
One day, we’ll wake, we break 
Finding fresh fields, make each step last.
Build new highways in a different way,
Beyond the footsteps in a day.

[Chorus - Repeat: hopeful, uplifting]
Footsteps in a day, unchartered ground,
Time’s a wheel, forever spins, 
break the cycle, 
let new life begin.
From dawn to dusk, we hold the key,
to trace new paths, and be free!

Oh-Oh. We are free!
Oh-Oh. We are free!
[end]
