#Verse
Dreams take flight
When inner sparks ignite
Light it up, and change your world

#Verse
On the edge, ready to be free
A bright mind stands idle
With endless possibilities

#Pre-Chorus
No more doubt, no more fear
Visions lead to new frontiers
An idea. Write it down!

#Pre-Chorus
No more doubt, no more fear
Visions lead to new frontiers
An idea. Write it down!

#Chorus
Genius inside, waiting to shine
Ideas like stars, lighting the night
Light up your spark, let dreams take flight
Unleash the sleeping genius inside!

#Verse
Zero: a simple idea
It changed it all
Add dreams to your world
And watch your life stand tall

#Pre-Chorus
Rise above, stand out proud
Let your voice be heard in the crowd

#Chorus
Genius inside, waiting to shine
Ideas like stars (light stars), lighting the night
Light up your spark, let dreams take flight
Unleash the sleeping genius inside!
Oh-Oh!

#Bridge
The future calls, don't turn away
Every idea leads to brighter days
Stand tall, make it known
This is the time, a new path to own

#Outro
Dreams take flight
Bringing the light
Wake up that Genius Inside!

#Hook
No more doubt!
Bringing the light (Bringing the light)
Wake up that Genius Inside!
