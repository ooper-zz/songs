[Intro]  
[grand piano, acoustic guitar]

Dreams take flight,
when inner sparks ignite. 
Light it up, and change your world...

[Verse 1]  
On the edge, ready to be free,  
A bright mind stands idle,
with endless possibilities.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
No more doubt, no more fear,  
Visions lead to new frontiers.  
An idea...write it down!

[Chorus]  
Genius inside, waiting to shine,  
Ideas like stars, lighting the night.  
light up your spark, let dreams take flight,  
unleash the sleeping genius inside! 

[Verse 2]  
zero...a simple idea,
it changed it all
add dreams to your world, 
and watch your life stand tall. 

[Pre-Chorus]  
Rise above, stand out proud,  
Let your voice be heard in the crowd.  

[Chorus]  
Genius inside, waiting to shine,  
Ideas like stars, lighting the night.  
light up your spark, let dreams take flight,  
unleash the sleeping genius inside! 
Oh-Oh!

[interlude]

[Bridge]  
The future calls, donâ€™t turn away,  
Every idea leads to brighter days.  
Stand tall, make it known,  
This is the time, a new path to own.  

[Outro]  
Dreams take flight,  
Bringing the light.
Wake up that Genius Inside!
