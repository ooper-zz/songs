[Verse 1]
In the coma’s grip, holding tight,
Prayed for morning, through the night.
Bent but not broken, hearts so brave,
Waiting for the strength to save.

[Chorus]
In the storm, they stand tall,
Be a beacon, through it all.
Every day, from dusk to dawn,
In love and trust, they move on.

[Verse 2]
Two stars in the night,
One strong, one light.
An old tree, a young leaf,
Unified, the tree survives.

[Chorus]
In the storm, they stand tall,
Be a beacon, through it all.
Every day, from dusk to dawn,
In love and trust, they move on.

[Verse 3]
Through years and tears, they held hope,
Seeking to right, every wrong with courage and wisdom.
Hey Dad, hey son, by the bed,
Bent up, holding on, words unsaid.

[Chorus]
In the storm, they stand tall,
Be a beacon, through it all.
Every day, from dusk to dawn,
In love and trust, they move on.

[Bridge]
In the silence, grace abounds,
Love in moments, strength unbound.
Hey Dad, the water’s near,
Hey son, I’m here, no fear.

[Chorus]
In the storm, they stand tall,
Be a beacon, through it all.
Every day, from dusk to dawn,
In love and trust, they move on.

[Outro]
Hey, you two, hand in hand,
Together strong, you will stand.
In every heartbeat, every ember,
Cherish life, give it a chance.
