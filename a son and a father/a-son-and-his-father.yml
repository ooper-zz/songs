[Verse 1]
Two stars in the night,
One strong, one light.
An old tree, a young leaf,
Unified, the tree survives.

[Chorus]
In the storm, they stand tall,
Be a beacon, through it all.
Every day, from dusk to dawn,
In love and trust, they move on.

[Verse 2]
Through years and tears, they held hope,
Seeking to right, every wrong with courage and wisdom.

[Chorus]
In the storm, they stand tall,
Be a beacon, through it all.
Every day, from dusk to dawn,
In love and trust, they move on.

[Bridge]
In the silence, grace abounds,
Love in moments, strength unbound.

[Chorus]
In the storm, they stand tall,
Be a beacon, through it all.
Every day, from dusk to dawn,
In love and trust, they move on.

[Outro]
A son and his father, hand in hand,
Together strong, they will stand.
In every heartbeat, every ember,
Cherish life, give it a chance.
