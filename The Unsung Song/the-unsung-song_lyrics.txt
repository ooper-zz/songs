[intro brief soft grand piano prolog ]

A song is written...

[verse 1]
Where rivers run, their stories fade,
Yet life blooms in the paths they made.
Lose to give, give to find!

oh-oh-oh

Sing the unsung song with me...

[Chorus upbeat]:
A destination swept off course,
A river vein feeds pastures wide,
Breeds new life, yet dries before the tide,
The lyrics of the unsung song!

Bridge:
Lakes reflect, yet hold their fill,
Do rivers dream, or just fulfill?

[hook]
Sing the unsung song with me...

[Chorus upbeat]:
A destination swept off course,
A river vein feeds pastures wide,
Breeds new life, yet dries before the tide,
The lyrics of the unsung song..

Outro:
Do we live the riverâ€™s flow,
Or fulfill the lives we sow?

The song's been written...
