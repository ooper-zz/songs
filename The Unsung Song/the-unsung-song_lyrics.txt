[intro soft grand piano ]

[Chorus upbeat]:
A destination swept off course,
A river vein feeds pastures wide,
Breeds new life, yet dries too soon,
The lyrics of the unsung song!

[verse 1]
Where rivers run, their stories fade,
Yet life blooms in the paths they've made.
Lose to give, give to find!

Would you sing the unsung song with me?

[interlude]

Bridge:
Lakes reflect, yet hold their fill,
Do rivers dream, or just fulfill?

[hook]
Sing the unsung song with me...

[Chorus upbeat]:
A destination swept off course,
A river vein feeds pastures wide,
Breeds new life, yet dries before the tide,
The lyrics of the unsung song!!

[breath]

Outro:
Do we live the riverâ€™s flow,
Or fulfill the lives we sow?

The song's been written...
Would you sing the unsung song, with me...

[fade out]
